markets, such as Detroit and Oakland,
to oversee funds that invest money in
these projects and neighborhoods; and

requirements. The fund would provide
loans to developers of mixed-use
projects in targeted areas of the City.
City-funded costs would be limited to
those authorized by Chapter 165 of the
Revised Code. All projects require
prior approval by an oversight board,
consisting of City and participating

Economic
Development to enter into an agreement
with
Cleveland
Citywide
Development
Corporation,
or
its
designees, to implement several programs in order to improve housing
opportunities in the neighborhoods
of the City of Cleveland.
Whereas, the City wants to spur
investment in areas that have not seen
private investment; and
Whereas, in many neighborhoods, it
is market and cost forces, rather than
lack
of
interest
that
impedes
development; and
Whereas,
challenge
to
secure
traditional bank financing in many
neighborhoods because the cost of
construction far exceeds the appraised
value of properties; and
Whereas, in order to develop infill
housing in neighborhoods, programs
are required to write down costs of
construction towards appraised value
and a mix of construction subsidies
and
homeowner
subsidies
are
required; and
Whereas, Detroit has had some
success with a Home Mortgage
Program, which provides guaranteed
second mortgages to help write down
these costs and banks have indicated
a willingness to replicate this model in
Cleveland; and
Whereas, banks will participate on
construction
loans
for
strong
developers with sufficient subsidy;
and
Whereas, down payment assistance
will help homeowners meet equity
requirements; and
Whereas, it is the goal to fund up to
75 new houses in targeted areas, with
a
mix
of
new
construction,
rehabilitation for new occupancy and
homeowner rehabilitation;
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Directors of
Community
Development
and/or
Economic Development are authorized to enter into an agreement
with Cleveland Citywide Development Corporation (CCDC), or its
designees, to implement several programs in order to improve housing
opportunities in the neighborhoods
of the City of Cleveland in areas

Conwell, Dow, J. Johnson, K. Johnson,
Kazy, Keane, McCormack, Mitchell,
Polensek, Reed, and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Senate to reject the proposed amendment to the state budget bill that gives the Ohio Department of Health exclusive authority
over all lead-based paint issues
statewide, and preempts Ohio cities
from taking proactive efforts to prevent lead-poisoning through local
inspection and enforcement.
Whereas, an amendment to the
Ohio budget bill, House Bill, 49,
added
by
Representative,
Derek
Merrin (R), gives the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) sole authority to regulate inspection, enforcement and abatement of led-based
paint statewide; and

May 10, 2017
Whereas, this budget bill amendment passed the Ohio House of Representatives, and if passed by the
Ohio Senate, would preempt Ohio
cities from taking proactive efforts
to prevent lead-poisoning through
local lead hazard inspections and
enforcement; and
Whereas,
as
the
amendment
stands, a city could do no more than
what the state allows, which currently involves reacting to lead poisoning cases and performing an
environmental investigation of a
home, school, or daycare after a
child has been poisoned; and
Whereas, the proposed changes
place sole responsibility for leadpaint related issues with ODH officials at a time when the department
faces major potential cuts in federal funding for training and certification of contractors to perform
lead-safe renovation and to assist
states with lead poisoning prevention, while the state dedicates little
from its own budget to lead poisoning prevention and enforcement; and
Whereas, cities such as Cleveland
and Toledo have turned to local lead
enforcement efforts, because federal
and state laws have not addressed
the problem; and
Whereas, experts, including the
National Center for Healthy Homes,
recommend local rental inspections
as a way to reduce the number of
homes in a community that pose a
risk to children from lead-based
paint hazards ; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the need for local proactive enforcement efforts to protect our children
from lead-poisoning, and urges the
Ohio Senate to reject the proposed
amendment to the state budget bill
that gives exclusive authority over
all lead-based paint issues to ODH;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio Senate to reject the proposed amendment to the state budget bill that gives the Ohio Department of Health exclusive authority
over all lead-based paint issues
statewide, and preempts Ohio cities
from proactive efforts to prevent
lead-poisoning through local inspection and enforcement.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution
to
the
Ohio
Senate
members.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

appeals for relief from the strict

which
states that a Motor Vehicle Repair
Garage in Semi-Industry District

use is abutting a residence district.

3. Section 352.07(b) which states
that a determination is required by
the Board of Zoning Appeals for a
change of use on a site that is nonconforming with respect to the
required landscaping. The subject
property is non-conforming in that it
lacks a required six foot wide landscaped transition strip which would
screen the parking lot from West
41st Street and lacks a 10 foot wide
transition strip with 75% opacity
abutting the residential district, per
Sections 352.08 through 352.12. (Filed
