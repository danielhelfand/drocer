Project Summary and Discussion
Statler Cleveland Holding, LLC or
designee, (“Developer”) is proposing
a mixed use redevelopment located
at 1127 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland,
OH 44115 and 1111 Hickory Court,

Cleveland OH 44114 (“Project Site”).
In order to assist with the project
financing,
the
Developer
has
requested the City impose a 5709.41,
30-Year, Non-School TIF. The TIF
will support debt service related to
the project and assist with the redevelopment
of
approximately
297
market rate apartments, approximately 7,740 square feet of retail
space, and parking for residents.
The project will create and/or cause
to create 26 new full-time jobs at the
Project Site with an approximate
payroll of $850,000 and retain/cause
to retain 6 jobs.
Statler Cleveland Holding, LLC is

acquire, recapitalize, and redevelop
both existing and newly acquired
assets, utilizing a variety of financing tools. MHD has extensive history developing Low-Income Housing
Tax Credit and market rate projects.
They

completed
the
Garfield, a mixed-use housing redevelopment of the historic Garfield
building at 1965 East 6th Street in
Downtown Cleveland. Their newest
project is the Statler Arms building,
which they purchased in January
2018.
The Statler Arms building is one
of the oldest residential buildings in
Downtown Cleveland. The building
opened in 1912 as Hotel Statler
along
Cleveland’s
storied
main
street, at the intersection of East
12th and Euclid. The building functioned as the Statler Tower, an
office building, from approximately
1971 through 2001, when it was converted into an apartment building.
The projects location in Playhouse
Square along the Euclid Avenue
transit corridor makes it a prime
opportunity for renovated apartment
units. The total project investment
is expected to exceed $56 million.

the Director of Economic Development to enter into a 30-year
non-school
Tax

the project to be a public purpose and exempt 100% of the
improvements from real property taxes.
• The Developer agrees to make
certain improvements to the

Metropolitan School District in
the amount the District would
