Southern Railway Company (“NS”) and 
CSX Corporation and CSX Transporta- 
tion, Inc. (“CSX”) filed a joint applica- 
tion with the Surface Transportation 
Board (“Board”) seeking authority for 
NS an CSX to acquire and divide cer- 
tain assets of Conrail; and 
Whereas, on September 22, 1997, 
this Council approved Resolution No. 
1799-97, wherein the Council, inter 
alia, strongly urged the Board to 
review the proposed acquisition and 
distribution of the assets of Conrail 
with consideration of the negative 
impacts 
such 
transaction 
would 
have on the citizens of the City of 
Cleveland and the Greater Cleveland 
area, including safety issues such as 
increase in injuries to citizens and 
the increase in delays in emergency 
equipment response, and environ- 
mental issues related to air and 
noise pollution and the shipment of 
hazardous cargo; and 
Whereas, Cleveland intervened in 
the proceeding before the Board in 
order to avoid significant adverse 
environmental 
impacts 
resulting 
from anticipated increases in rail 
traffic in Cleveland’s neighborhoods 
should the Board approve the joint 
application; and 
Whereas, on June 4, 1998, the 
Mayor executed a Settlement Agree- 
ment with CSX which, subject to rat- 
ification and approval by this Coun- 
cil, would commit CSX to make cap- 
ital investments in Cleveland and 
financial contributions to Cleveland 
in order to ameliorate and mitigate 
the adverse environmental impacts 
in Cleveland resulting from increas- 
es in rail traffic by CSX and would 
result in significant benefits to the 
City and its residents, including job 
opportunities at local CSX facilities;

County Commissioners for Cuyahoga

respective bodies on or about May 
28, 1998, approving a three phase 
plan for the construction of a juve- 
nile detention center and affiliated 
court buildings and other acces- 
sories, as set forth in the design 
drawing of Thomas Zung, Archi- 
tects/Richard Bowen & Associates, 
dated May 28, 1998; and 
Whereas, 
local 
community 
ap- 
proval is also required by the Ohio 
Department of Youth Services as 
indicated in the outline of required 
steps in the correspondence of April 
30, 1998, addressed to the Board of 
County 
Commissioners 
from 
the 
Director of the Ohio Department of 
Youth Services, Geno Natalucci-Per- 
sichetti; and 
Whereas, the local community 
authority is constituted in the City 
Council who is not opposed to the 
plan indicated above, but is not will- 
ing to provide local community 
approval unless and until the fol- 
lowing conditions have been satis- 
fied: 
(a) A detailed timetable for all 
phases being constructed has been 
provided; and 
(b) A realistic and identifiable 
source of funding for all three 
phases has been put in place bind- 
ing the County and all sources of 
such funding so as to accomplish 
same within the next three to five 
years; and 
(c) That the Council is satisfied 
as to the long range viability of the 
plan and that it is conducive to the 
proper care of the children being 
housed and handled in such facili- 
ties. 
Whereas, the proposed site on and 
about the existing premises for the 
Juvenile Court on 22nd Street is con- 
trary to the City Zoning Code, in 
that Section 337.08(e)(8) specifically 
prohibits correctional facilities in 
this zoning district, and that any 
use in contradiction of the Code 
which is non-conforming in nature 
must obtain a zoning variance for 
any “enlargement or expansion” pur- 
suant to Chapter 359 of the Codified 
Ordinances of the City of Cleveland,

ers have not addressed the concerns 
as protected under Chapter 161 of 
the Codified Ordinances relating to 
Landmark Commission approvals, 
and buildings of a special historic, 
community, or aesthetic interest or 
value; and 
Whereas, as the protector of the 
local community, it is this Council’s 
duty, before approving the proposed 
plan, to assure that the proper care 
is being provided to the children of 
this community, and that the plan 
will provide a viable institution for 
the protection of the health, safety, 
and welfare of our constituents;

Section 1. That the Council of the 
City of Cleveland, does hereby and

An emergency resolution opposing 
any attempts to privatize the United 
States Postal Service. 
Whereas, the Council of the City 
of Cleveland recognize all the men 
and women who work for the Unit- 
ed States Postal Service and who 
have served the American public in 
this constitutionally authorized ser- 
vice during the past 220 years, and 
Whereas, thousand of dedicated 
postal employees commit their lives 
and careers to processing and deliv- 
ering America’s mail to businesses 
and residents throughout the coun- 
try in a timely and efficient manner 
and at the least cost to American 
taxpayers; and 
Whereas, a postal service operat- 
ed by private sector carriers has 
been historically rejected by the 
United States Congress and the 
American people, and 
Whereas, the United States Postal 
Service 
has 
attempted 
to 
move 
toward privatization through award- 
ing a contract to Emery Worldwide 
Airlines to create a new Priority 
Mail network, which appears to be 
a backdoor privatization effort by 
administrative practice rather than 
by Congressional policy, a practice 
this Council strongly oppose; and 
Whereas, this resolution consti- 
tutes an emergency measure provid- 
ing for the usual daily operation of 
a municipal department;

the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland is opposed to any
efforts by the United States Postal
Service that result, both directly or
indirectly, in the privatization of the
United States Postal Service and the
loss of jobs for dedicated postal
employees and hereby urges the
United States Postal Service to
reject any such measure which
result in privatization of services
provided by the Postal Service. This
Council urges the United States Con-
gress to take appropriate action to
prevent the United States Postal Ser-
vice from taking any such actions
which may result in the privatiza-
tion of such services.

An emergency resolution request- 
ing that the FirstEnergy Corpora- 
tion withdraw recently issued layoff 
notices to its employees, and return 
to the bargaining table to reach a 
fair labor agreement. 
Whereas, the FirstEnergy Corpo- 
ration’s decision to terminate nego- 
tiations with the Utility Workers 
Union of America, Local 270 and 
implement a contract is contrary to 
the idea of fairness to workers and 
the federally recognized collective 
bargaining process; and 
Whereas, the elimination of 485 
jobs by the FirstEnergy Corporation, 
will result in lower electric service 
levels for Cleveland residents; and 
Whereas, the reduction in service 
caused as a result of these layoffs 
could result in potentially danger- 
ous delays in the restoration of elec- 
tric power to Cleveland residents in 
the event of an emergency; and 
Whereas, the reduction in service 
caused as a result of these layoffs 
may result in the FirstEnergy Cor- 
poration’s noncompliance with mini- 
mum 
electric 
service 
standards 
established by the Public Utilities 
Commission of Ohio; and 
[End Column One]
Whereas, the elimination of these 
positions will unfairly harm work- 
ing families and the Cleveland com- 
munity; and 
Whereas, 
the 
Utility 
Workers 
Union of America, Local 270, has 
sought an immediate court injunction 
to prevent the elimination of these 
positions and has sought relief from 
the National Labor Relations Board; 
Now, therefore, be it resolved by 
the Council of the City of Cleveland: 
Section 1. That the FirstEnergy 
Corporation should immediately with- 
draw all job layoff notices issued to
its employees as part of the planned
elimination of 485 jobs announced on
Wednesday, May 27, 1998. 
Section 2. That the FirstEnergy 
Corporation should return to the bar- 
gaining table with the Utility Work- 
ers Union of America, Local 270, in 
order to reach a fair labor agreement 
in accordance with federally recog- 
nized labor negotiation processes. 
Section 3. That the Clerk of Coun- 
cil be and she is hereby directed to 
transmit certified copies of this res- 
olution to Anthony Alexander, Pres- 
ident of the FirstEnergy Corpora- 
tion, Dan DiNicola, Spokesman for 
FirstEnergy Corporation, John Ryan, 
President of the Cleveland AFL-CIO, 
and David Kotecki, President of the 
Utilities Workers Union of America,
