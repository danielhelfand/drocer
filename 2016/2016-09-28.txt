ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1079-16.
By Council Member Zone.
An emergency resolution opposing
the
proposed
Dakota
Access
Pipeline and expressing solidarity
with the Indigenous Resistance to
that proposed pipeline.
Whereas, the proposed Dakota
Access Pipeline would carry as
many as 570,000 barrels of fracked
crude oil per day for more than 1,100
miles from the Bakken oil fields of
North Dakota to Illinois, passing
over sensitive landscape including
treaty protected land containing recognized
cultural
resources
and
across or under 209 rivers, creeks
and tributaries including the pristine Missouri River, which provides
drinking water and irrigates agricultural land in communities across
the Midwest; and
Whereas, despite deep opposition
from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe,
as well as farmers, scientists, more
than 30 environmental advocacy
groups and 566 Tribal nations worldwide, without Tribal consultation or
meaningful environmental review as
required by federal law, in July,
2016 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a permit allowing construction of the fracked oil pipeline
to move forward; and
Whereas, in a show of cooperation
not seen in the 140 years since the
Battle of Greasy Grass or Custer’s
Last Stand, members of the Lakota
Standing Rock Sioux Tribe have
united with the Oceti Sakowin, the

Seven Fires Council – which include
the confederation of Lakota, Dakota
and Nakota Nations – and established a peaceful encampment in
Cannon Ball, North Dakota known
as Sacred Stones Camp to resist the
construction of the Dakota Access
Pipeline with a cultural and spiritual presence; and
Whereas, on August 15, 2016 the
Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Council
led
by
Tribal
Chairman
David
Archambault II called on Tribal
Nations
and
Indigenous
people
around the world to issue resolutions in support of the Standing
Rock Sioux and the Sacred Stone
Camp which has been answered
with the supporting Tribes numbering 566; and
Whereas, this Council also recognizes the City’s own Indigenous
roots beginning with the Mound
Builders all the way to the Iroquois,
Seneca, Chippewa and Algonquians,
and many others; with these cultures as our roots, we are bound to
protect water, just as the shores of
Lake Erie are center to life here in
Cleveland, so too the Standing Rock
Sioux recognize and understand that
without water, there is no life; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the proposed Dakota Access
Pipeline and expresses solidarity
with the Indigenous Resistance to
that proposed pipeline.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to President Obama, all
members
of
the
United
States
Congress
and
Standing
Rock
Reservation.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
