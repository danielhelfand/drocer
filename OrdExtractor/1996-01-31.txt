owned by a person who fails to sat-

The City Record
isfy a judgment entered in a case
involving a traffic offense and urging its swift passage by the General Assembly.
Whereas,
recent
state
law
changes required that an application for registration or registration
renewal be denied because of the
existence of unpaid parking tickets

restrictions to require the denial of
an application for registration or
registration renewal if the registration is prohibited from being accepted because of a court order relative
to misdemeanor traffic or motor
vehicle-related violations; and

Senate Bill 121 will provide an effective tool to enforce the traffic laws
against persons who do not appear
in court to answer for misdemeanor
traffic offenses or who fail to satisfy judgments rendered by a court;
