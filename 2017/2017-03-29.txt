FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 325-17.
By Council Members Cleveland and
McCormack.
An emergency resolution calling
upon the Ohio Department of Health
to fully restore Ryan White Part B
funding for fiscal year 2017-2018 to
the AIDS Taskforce of Greater
Cleveland.
Whereas, recently the AIDS Taskforce of Greater Cleveland (ATGC)
was given verbal notice that in the
next 30 days it will not continue to
receive Ryan White Part B funding;
and
Whereas, this notification from
the Ohio Department of Health
comes without any written justification in response to the ATGC’s
strong and competitive application
for Ryan White Part B funding; and
Whereas, for nearly 35 years, the
ATGC has served the greater Cleveland metropolitan area with excellence in community and public
health service; and
Whereas, despite fluctuating government support, the ATGC has tirelessly advocated for and served
thousands of people living with
HIV/AIDS who are often the most
vulnerable people because they are
often sick, uninsured, marginalized
or indigent; and
Whereas, without the Ryan White
Part B funding, the ATGC will lose
at least nine full-time case management positions with an average of
10-15 years’ experience;
Whereas, the health and welfare
of some 350 clients of ATGC will be
negatively impacted as they will no
longer be able to get the compassion
and care provided by the ATGC,
which includes continuity of care in
one location, assistance in accessing
life sustaining treatment, navigating medical insurance eligibility;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council calls
upon the Ohio Department of Health
to fully restore Ryan White Part B
funding for fiscal year 2017-2018 to
the AIDS Taskforce of Greater
Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to provide copies of this
resolution
to
Richard

Written Examination:
DATE: Saturday, June 24, 2017
TIME: 9:00 a.m.
PLACE: THE CLEVELAND PUBLIC AUDITORIUM, 500 Lakeside Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44114
Written Examination: This is a paper and pencil examination that will consist of approximately 80 multiple-choice items
designed to assess candidates’ understanding of job-related technical knowledge determined to be important to the
Cleveland Fire Captain position based on the job analysis results. Items will be developed based on the information contained in the reference materials outlined in the Reading List. As noted on the Reading List, this examination will consist of two parts, a closed-book test and an open-book test. The Reading List specifies which sections of each document
will be covered on the closed-book test and which sections will be covered on the open-book test. The allocation of items
to the closed-book and open-book tests will be based on the job analysis results.
The closed-book test items will be designed to assess candidates’ understanding of job-related technical knowledge that
the job analysis indicates must be memorized so no reference materials will be available for use during this part of the
Written Examination. Items on this part will be drawn ONLY from reference materials identified on the Reading List as
closed-book.
The open-book test items will be designed to assess candidates’ understanding of job-related technical knowledge that
the job analysis indicates need not be memorized but can be looked up when needed. Therefore, ALL reference materials included on the Reading List (closed-book and open-book) and any other documents candidates may wish to bring
will be available for use during the open-book part of the Written Examination. However, items on this part will be
drawn ONLY from reference materials identified on the Reading List as open-book.
All candidates who complete the Written Examination will be eligible to participate in the Oral Board Examination.

March 29, 2017

Oral Board Examination: This Examination is designed to assess competencies found to underlie effective job performance in the context of typical situations encountered by Cleveland Fire Captains. This component will consist of two
exercises requiring candidates to conduct such activities as commanding an incident scene, conducting meetings with
other fire personnel or civilians who are experiencing some problems or expressing some complaints, or conducting
other activities that a Captain might reasonably be expected to conduct. Candidates will be given an opportunity to
review written scenarios describing each situation and to prepare their responses before appearing before the Oral
Boards to conduct each exercise. Candidates will then be given a set amount of time to present their responses to the
Oral Boards which will consist of raters trained to evaluate their performance. The raters will be drawn from agencies
outside the Cleveland Division of Fire. Total candidate participation time for the Oral Board will be approximately one
hour and 45 minutes including time to check-in and review instructions, time to review exercise materials and prepare
responses, and time to appear before each Oral Board to conduct each exercise.
Based on the job analysis of the Fire Captain position, this component will be designed to allow for an assessment of
such competencies as: oral communication, interpersonal interactions, analyzing and deciding, managing activities, and
adaptability.
Candidates will NOT be permitted to bring any reference materials identified on the Reading List nor any other documents to the Oral Board Examination site. Any reference materials or other documents that might be needed to respond

Written Examination Reading List Explanation
Explanation of Reading List: Candidates for promotion to Captain will be responsible for the reference sources listed on
the attached Reading List. This list is organized by general source (e.g., CFD General Orders), identifies the specific
sections (e.g., CATEGORY 1: EMERGENCY FIELD OPERATIONS, Number 1-29: Truss Roofs) of each source that may
be included on the Written Examination, and indicates whether each section will be covered on the “Closed-Book” or
“Open-Book” part of the Written Examination. Decisions regarding the inclusion and placement of material were made
based on information collected from the job analysis of the position of Cleveland Division of Fire Captain.
Please note that in some cases not all existing sections of a source are included on the Reading List. For instance, CATEGORY 2: ROUTINE FIELD OPERATIONS, Number 2-2 Public Service Incident Responses of the CFD General Orders

sources, such as the CFD General Orders, some sections will be covered on the Closed-Book part of the Written Examination while other sections will be covered on the Open-Book part of the Written Examination. In addition, the titles of
the sections from the CFD General Orders and CFD Standard Operating Procedures on the Reading List reflect the titles

EXAMINATION INFORMATION
The examination will consist of two components, a Written Examination and an Oral Board Examination. Each of these
components is described below.
Written Examination:
DATE: Saturday, June 24, 2017
TIME: 9:00 a.m.
PLACE: THE CLEVELAND PUBLIC AUDITORIUM, 500 Lakeside Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44114
Written Examination: This is a paper and pencil examination that will consist of approximately 80 multiple-choice items
designed to assess candidates’ understanding of job-related technical knowledge determined to be important to the
Cleveland Fire Lieutenant position based on the job analysis results. Items will be developed based on the information
contained in the reference materials outlined in the Reading List. As noted on the Reading List, this examination will
consist of two parts, a closed-book test and an open-book test. The Reading List specifies which sections of each document will be covered on the closed-book test and which sections will be covered on the open-book test. The allocation of
items to the closed-book and open-book tests will be based on the job analysis results.
The closed-book test items will be designed to assess candidates’ understanding of job-related technical knowledge that
the job analysis indicates must be memorized so no reference materials will be available for use during this part of the
Written Examination. Items on this part will be drawn ONLY from reference materials identified on the Reading List as
closed-book.
The open-book test items will be designed to assess candidates’ understanding of job-related technical knowledge that
the job analysis indicates need not be memorized but can be looked up when needed. Therefore, ALL reference materials included on the Reading List (closed-book and open-book) and any other documents candidates may wish to bring
will be available for use during the open-book part of the Written Examination. However, items on this part will be
drawn ONLY from reference materials identified on the Reading List as open-book.
All candidates who complete the Written Examination will be eligible to participate in the Oral Board Examination.
Oral Board Examination: This Examination is designed to assess competencies found to underlie effective job performance in the context of typical situations encountered by Cleveland Fire Lieutenants. This component will consist of
two exercises requiring candidates to conduct such activities as commanding an incident scene, conducting meetings
with other fire personnel or civilians who are experiencing some problems or expressing some complaints, or conducting other activities that a Lieutenant might reasonably be expected to conduct. Candidates will be given an opportunity to review written scenarios describing each situation and to prepare their responses before appearing before the Oral
Boards to conduct each exercise. Candidates will then be given a set amount of time to present their responses to the
Oral Boards which will consist of raters trained to evaluate their performance. The raters will be drawn from agencies
outside the Cleveland Division of Fire. Total candidate participation time for the Oral Board will be approximately one
hour and 45 minutes including time to check-in and review instructions, time to review exercise materials and prepare
responses, and time to appear before each Oral Board to conduct each exercise.
Based on the job analysis of the Fire Lieutenant position, this component will be designed to allow for an assessment of
such competencies as: oral communication, interpersonal interactions, analyzing and deciding, managing activities, and
adaptability.
Candidates will NOT be permitted to bring any reference materials identified on the Reading List nor any other documents to the Oral Board Examination site. Any reference materials or other documents that might be needed to respond
to the situations presented will be made available to candidates at the examination site.
Applicants will be notified of the date, time, and place of their Oral Board Examination.
THE USE OF THE FOLLOWING DURING EITHER EXAMINATION WILL BE PROHIBITED: ANY ELECTRONIC
DEVICES (E.G. CELLPHONES, EARPHONES, EARPLUGS, CALCULATORS, RADIOS INCLUDING DEPARTMENTAL
RADIOS, PAGERS, TAPE RECORDERS, TAPE PLAYERS, WATCHES THAT CAN RECEIVE OR TRANSMIT DATA),
AND SCRAP PAPER. APPLICANTS BRINGING THE AFOREMENTIONED ARTICLES TO THE EXAMINATION SITE
WILL HAVE THEM CONFISCATED.

Following the administration of the written part of the examination, the question and answers thereto which the Commission proposes to use in grading the examination shall be available to applicants in such examinations…for a period
of five (5) working days. During this five (5) day period, any competitor who desires to challenge any answer contained
in the tentative answer key shall submit such challenge in writing together with authoritative proof of his/her claim.
All such written challenges shall be considered by the Commission provided, however, that the identity of the applicants
submitting the challenges shall not be known to the Commission. If the Commission is satisfied as to the validity of such
proposed changes and/or amendments, they shall be made part of the examination answer key. The original examination answer key together with any changes and/or amendments thereto shall constitute the final examination answer
key. No further requests for changes and/or amendments to the examination answer key shall be entertained by the
Commission. Only the final examination answer key shall be used in scoring all examination papers. Note: Applicants
will be notified of the dates, times, and location of this review at the written exam.

sheets as stated in the examination announcement. Candidates will be notified by mail as to the time and place of said
review.
5.20 ESTABLISHMENT OF ELIGIBLE LIST
From the returns of each competitive examination, the Commission shall prepare and keep open to the public inspection
of an eligible list of the persons … who are otherwise eligible. Such persons shall be notified and take rank upon the eligible list in order of their relative grades. The grade of any applicant failing to qualify shall not be made public.
5.11 BREAKING OF EXAMINATION TIE SCORES
In a Promotional Examination, should two (2) or more applicants receive the same grade, seniority in the classification
from which the promotion is sought shall determine the order in which their names shall be placed on the eligible list.
If the applicants are still tied after the aforementioned seniority has been considered, seniority and grade in the next
lower ranks shall be used as necessary. If the applicants are still tied, placement on the eligible list will be determined
by random selection. The Civil Service Commission shall determine the method of random selection.
NOTE: Any applicant protesting a question or answer will have to submit his/her protest in writing on the approved
Civil Service Objection Form. All protest forms must be turned in upon the applicant’s completion of the review period.
No objection forms will be accepted: 1) before or after the review period, or 2) at any location other than the location designated for review. Anyone who does not follow the instructions on the objection form will lose the right to their objection. The Commission shall not entertain any objections other than those on the approved form.
NOTE: Applicants will be required to give their examination identification number, rank of examination applied for,
printed name, and signature on the Civil Service Objection Form. Applicants who do not provide this information will
not have their protests addressed.
NOTE: In lieu of a hearing before the Civil Service Commission regarding challenges, the Commission reserves the right

AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER
2017 City of Cleveland Division of Fire Lieutenant Promotion Examination
Written Examination Reading List Explanation
Explanation of Reading List: Candidates for promotion to Lieutenant will be responsible for the reference sources listed on the attached Reading List. This list is organized by general source (e.g., CFD General Orders), identifies the specific sections (e.g., CATEGORY 1: EMERGENCY FIELD OPERATIONS, Number 1-29: Truss Roofs) of each source that
may be included on the Written Examination, and indicates whether each section will be covered on the “Closed-Book”
or “Open-Book” part of the Written Examination. Decisions regarding the inclusion and placement of material were
made based on information collected from the job analysis of the position of Cleveland Division of Fire Lieutenant.
Please note that in some cases not all existing sections of a source are included on the Reading List. For instance, CATEGORY 2: ROUTINE FIELD OPERATIONS, Number 2-2 Public Service Incident Responses of the CFD General Orders
has been omitted. You should also note that in some overall sources, such as the Manual of Rules and Regulations, all
sections that are included will be tested on the same part (i.e., Open-Book) of the Written Examination, and in other
sources, such as the CFD General Orders, some sections will be covered on the Closed-Book part of the Written Examination while other sections will be covered on the Open-Book part of the Written Examination. In addition, the titles of
the sections from the CFD General Orders and CFD Standard Operating Procedures on the Reading List reflect the titles
included on the Table of Contents, not the titles included in the actual sections of these overall sources. Finally, please
note that for the external textbooks, the publisher’s website has been identified to assist candidates in ordering and
obtaining each external text.  
Additional Points about the Reading List and Examination Procedures:
1. All questions on the Closed-Book part of the Written Examination will be drawn from sections identified on the reading list as “Closed.”
Candidates will NOT be permitted to use any reference sources on the Reading List or other documents of any kind during the Closed-Book part of the Written Examination.
2. All questions on the Open-Book part of the Written Examination will be drawn from sections identified on the reading list as “Open.”
Candidates WILL be permitted to use any references sources on the Reading List or other documents during the OpenBook part of the Written Examination.
3. Only hard copies of reference sources/documents may be brought to the Written Examination. No electronic equipment will be allowed at the examination administration site, including pagers, cellphones, laptops, etc.
4. Candidates must obtain and bring their own copies of reference sources/documents to the Written Examination. No
documents will be provided to candidates at the examination administration site. No sharing of any documents or materials will be allowed.
5. Where possible, candidates may reorganize the Open-Book sections of their reference sources into separate binders to
facilitate their efforts during the Open-Book part of the Written Examination.
6. Candidates will only be responsible for information contained within reference sources included on the Reading List.
Any other documents that are referenced within sources appearing on the Reading List, but are not actually included on
the Reading List themselves, will not be tested. Similarly, any additional reference or study materials included or made
available with purchase of a textbook (e.g., the Navigate 2 online course materials) will not be tested. Candidates are
not required to use or review these additional materials, but can do so if they feel it would be beneficial for their preparation for the promotional testing process.
7. Highlighting and writing in reference sources or other documents prior to the Written Examination administration is
permitted. Writing in reference sources or other documents during the Written Examination is NOT permitted. Writing in test booklets during the Written Examination is permitted and encouraged (pen, pencil and highlighter are
allowed).
8. Candidates will be responsible for obtaining the CFD’s internal reference sources including the General Orders, Standard Operating Procedures, CFD Manual of Rules and Regulations, and City of Cleveland Medical Protocols (EMT-B
Portion).
9. Any of the references sources appearing on the Reading List may be of relevance to the Oral Board Examination even
though the focus of the Oral Board Examination is on competencies.
Candidates will NOT be permitted to bring any reference sources on the Reading List or other documents to the Oral
Board Examination. However, any reference sources or other documents needed to respond to the Oral Board exercises
will be made available to candidates at the Oral Board Examination site.
More information about the examination procedures will be provided in the candidate preparation guides and in future
announcements.
All General Orders, Standard Operating Procedures, Medical Protocols, and Manual of Rules & Regulations are posted
on the Division of Fire’s internal SharePoint site. They will be able to download the material directly from the site.
They are also able to bring a portable drive to fire headquarters and have all of the files loaded onto it. Members are
responsible for obtaining this material!
