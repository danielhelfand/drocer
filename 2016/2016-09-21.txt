and
Whereas, the Director of Economic

nonprofit association (MCWP) was
organized
to
address
informally
environmental
conservacommon
tion, stormwater and development
concerns of communities within the
Mill Creek watershed, educate the
public on the importance of Mill
Creek and encourage cooperative
interaction among watershed stakeholders; and
Whereas, West Creek Preservation Committee, an Ohio nonprofit
corporation dba West Creek Conservancy (WCC), is organized as a nonprofit corporation under the laws of
the State of Ohio and qualified as a
charitable organization pursuant to
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code, whose purpose is to
conserve natural habitats, restore
ecological value and sustainability
of urban lands and expand neighborhood opportunities to experience
nature through land conservation
and watershed management activities; and
Whereas, WCC has developed the
Mill Creek Watershed Action Plan
according to Ohio EPA and Ohio
Department of Natural Resources
guidelines and acts as a watershed
coordinator to implement its recommendations; and
Whereas, in order to better support and implement the Mill Creek
Watershed Action Plan, WCC and
MCWP desire to form an alliance in

effectiveness of their common conservation and watershed management mission, afford economies of
scale and cost reduction by integration with WCC’s existing infrastructure
and
consolidation
of
administration costs and enhance
funding opportunities; and

This Council authorizes the City to

Revenue Bonds, or designated portions thereof, to obtain aggregate net
present value debt service savings of
at least three percent (3%), or to eliminate or modify covenants that are
unduly restrictive, or to obtain a more
favorable debt service structure or
more favorable terms under Credit
Support Instruments. With respect to
Outstanding Revenue Bonds that are
short-term or variable-rate obligations, this Council authorizes the City
to issue Refunding Bonds to refund
such Outstanding Revenue Bonds, or
designated portions thereof, for any
of the foregoing purposes or for the
purpose that the Director of Finance
has determined, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
such Outstanding Revenue Bonds are
subjecting the City to undesirably
high rates of interest or undesirable
fluctuations in rates of interest or
risks or expenses associated with
Credit Support Instruments or Hedge
Agreements that can economically be
avoided or mitigated through refunding. The principal amount of each
Series of Refunding Bonds is to be the
amount set forth in the Certificate of
Award authorized in Section 5 and
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, to be necessary (i) to refund the Refunded Bonds
to be refunded by that Series, (ii) to
fund any interest on the Refunding
Bonds, (iii) to fund any deposit to the
Bond Service Reserve Fund required
under the Trust Indenture or any special reserve fund for that Series separate from the Bond Service Reserve
Fund, (iv) to fund any deposit to the
Renewal and Replacement Fund
required under the Trust Indenture,
(v) to pay costs of any Credit Support

owed under Hedge Agreements, and
(vii) to pay costs of issuing the
Refunding Bonds and refunding the
Refunded Bonds.
Separate series of Refunding Bonds
may be issued at the same or different

The City Record
times. The Refunding Bonds of each
series shall be designated as provided
in the applicable Certificate of
Award. A separate Certificate of
Award and a separate Supplemental
Indenture may be delivered for each
series. The proceeds from the sale of
each Series of Refunding Bonds shall
be allocated, deposited and applied as
provided in Section 6. The Refunding
Bonds shall constitute Revenue
Bonds for all purposes of the Trust
Indenture.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Refunding
Bonds for a purpose provided in this
Ordinance serves a proper, public,
municipal purpose by reducing or stabilizing costs of air travel facilities
serving the people of the City of
Cleveland, thereby increasing and
promoting commerce by providing
necessary transportation for individuals and commercial enterprises purchasing and selling services and
products in northeastern Ohio, and
creating and preserving jobs and
employment opportunities in the City
and improving the economic welfare
of the City.
Section 3. Authorization of Hedging
Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging in interest rate hedging arrangements with respect to Revenue Bonds
the City may reduce its cost of borrowing by optimizing the relative
amounts of fixed and variable rate
obligations, or minimizing the risk of
variations in its debt service costs, or
obtaining savings by confirming
rates of interest on Revenue Bonds in
advance of their issuance. To permit
the City to have the flexibility to
undertake interest rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate collar and other
hedging transactions, from time to
time, and to establish the procedures
for approving those transactions, this
Council authorizes the signing and
delivery of one or more agreements
(each, a “Hedge Agreement”) and any
related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section 3 are supplemental to and not in
derogation of any authority provided
by any other ordinance of this Council
concerning hedging arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that it is to the financial advantage of
the City and in the City’s best interests that a hedging arrangement be
undertaken by the City with respect
to any Revenue Bonds issued or to be
issued under the Trust Indenture, the
Director of Finance may authorize
one or more interest rate hedge transactions in accordance with the applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that
the term of each hedge transaction
shall not exceed the final maturity of
the Revenue Bonds to which the
hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall negotiate the terms of each Hedge Agreement. The City shall receive a written
opinion of a Financial Advisor that
the payments made or to be made by
the counterparty to the City, or by the
City to the counterparty, shall be fair
value for the Hedge Agreement, considering, among other things, the
credit of the City’s Airport System,
the credit of the counterparty and the

1401

17
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall determine the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement, including without limitation, the time or
times and procedures for the exercise
by the counterparty or the City, as the
case may be, of any option under the
Hedge Agreement, whether the obligations of the City under the Hedge
Agreement shall be secured by a Credit Support Instrument, and the rates
to be paid by the counterparty to the
City and by the City to the counterparty under the Hedge Agreement in
the event of the exercise of the option.
The approval of each interest rate
hedge transaction by the Director of
Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery of
the applicable Hedge Agreement by
the Director of Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into an amendment,
modification or novation of any
Hedge Agreement or any Credit Support Instrument securing a Hedge
Agreement or to terminate any Hedge
Agreement, in whole or in part, if the
Director of Finance determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that (a) the
amendment, modification, novation or
termination is (i) justified by the corresponding benefit to the City, (ii)
commercially reasonable based on
then-current market conditions, and
(iii) in the City’s best interests, and
(b) any payments made or to be made
by the counterparty to the City, or by
the City to the counterparty, are fair
value for such amendment, modification, novation or termination, given
the credit of the counterparty and the
terms and conditions of the amendment, modification, novation or termination. To the extent that any
amounts to be paid by the City in connection with any such amendment,
modification, novation or termination
are not paid from proceeds of Revenue Bonds, those amounts shall be
paid from Fund Nos. 60SF 001, 60 SF
104, 60 SF 105, 60 SF 106 and 60 SF 141
and/or passenger facility charges, as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance after consultation with the
Director of Port Control.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Airport Revenues as defined
in the Trust Indenture and may be
payable also from other funds permitted by law to be used for the purpose,
as identified by the Director of
Finance in the Hedge Agreement.
Those payments may be secured by a
pledge of Airport Revenues, to the
extent permitted by the Trust Indenture, all as determined by the Director
of Finance and set forth in the Hedge
Agreement. The obligation of the City
to make payments under any Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not represent or constitute a general obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a
pledge of the faith and credit of the
City or the State of Ohio. Nothing
gives any party to any Hedge Agreement the right to have excises, ad valorem or other taxes levied by the City
or the State of Ohio for the payment of
any amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
In the event the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that it
is necessary to supplement or amend

18
the Trust Indenture or a Supplemental Indenture in connection with any
Hedge Agreement or any amendment,
modification, novation or termination
of any Hedge Agreement, the Mayor
and the Director of Finance are authorized to sign and deliver a Supplemental Indenture or amendment of an
existing Supplemental Indenture.
Section 4. Terms of Refunding
Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall contain
the terms provided in or determined
pursuant to, the Trust Indenture, this
Ordinance, the applicable Certificate
of Award and the applicable Supplemental Indenture. Each series of
Refunding Bonds may be secured by a
separate Supplemental Indenture, or
a single Supplemental Indenture may
secure more than one series of
Refunding Bonds.
(a) General. The Refunding Bonds
may be issued as obligations bearing
interest at fixed or variable interest
rates. In the event that the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, determines
that the City’s best interests will be
served by a series of Refunding
Bonds bearing interest at variable
interest rates, then provision shall be
made in the Supplemental Indenture
applicable to that series for the
method and procedure by which the
variable rate of interest to be borne
by the Refunding Bonds of that series
shall be determined (whether by reference to a market index, by a remarketing agent or otherwise); provided
that no series of variable rate Refunding Bonds shall bear interest at a rate
in excess of twenty-five percent
(25%) per year (including any
Refunding Bonds held by a provider
of a Credit Support Instrument). The
Director of Finance may determine
that the terms of a variable rate
series of Refunding Bonds may or
may not permit the holders to tender
their variable rate Refunding Bonds
for purchase by the City. If the Director of Finance designates any series
of Refunding Bonds as variable rate
Refunding Bonds, and if the Holders
of that series of Refunding Bonds are
to be entitled to tender those Refunding Bonds for purchase, then the
Director of Finance shall also designate for those variable rate Refunding Bonds (and may designate others,
from time to time, in substitution
therefor), the tender agent or agents
(which may be the Trustee) and the
remarketing agent or agents (which
may be any of the Original Purchasers), which designations shall be
based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed to
provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into agreements with
others in connection with the delivery
of the Refunding Bonds, and from
time to time thereafter so long as the
Refunding Bonds are outstanding, as
may be determined by the Director of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for (i) the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, (ii) the rights and procedures

The City Record
for tender, (iii) liquidity or credit support, (iv) repayment by the City of
any amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument, (v) the direct
purchase of tendered Refunding
Bonds, and (vi) other arrangements
in the best interests of the City. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any such agreements if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be served
by such termination. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to enter
into agreements, from time to time so
long as the variable rate Refunding
Bonds are outstanding, supplementing or amending the applicable Supplemental Indenture for a series of
Refunding Bonds as provided in Section 8. To the extent that any fees and
expenses associated with agreements
entered into or terminated pursuant
to this Section are not paid from proceeds of Revenue Bonds, those fees
and expenses shall be paid from Fund
Nos. 60 SF 001, 60 SF 104, 60 SF 105, 60
SF 106 and 60 SF 141 and/or passenger facility charges, as determined by
the Director of Finance after consultation with the Director of Port Control.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Refunding Bonds shall be issued
in fully registered form. The Refunding Bonds initially shall be delivered
only in book-entry form, shall be registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of the
Depository, and shall not be transferable or exchangeable (except for
transfer to another Depository or its
nominee) without further action by
the City pursuant to the provisions of
the Trust Indenture.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Refunding Bonds of any series for use
in a book entry system, the Director of
Finance and the Trustee may attempt
to
establish
a
securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance and the
Trustee do not or are unable to do so,
the Director of Finance and the
Trustee, after making provision for
notification of the beneficial owners
by the then Depository and any other
arrangements deemed necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the
Refunding Bonds of any series from
the Depository, and authenticate and
deliver registered Bond certificates to
the assigns of the Depository or its
nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of action or
inaction of the City, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into any agreements
determined by the Director to be necessary in connection with the book
entry system for the Refunding
Bonds, after determining that those
agreements will not endanger the
funds or securities of the City under
the Indenture (as evidenced by the
Director’s signing of those agreements).
(c) Dates; Denominations. The
Refunding Bonds of each series shall
be dated as of the date or dates provided in the Certificate of Award for

TITLE
CLEVELAND MINIMUM WAGE
Section 174.01 Definitions
For purposes of this Chapter:
(a) “An individual employed in or
about the property of an employer or
individual’s residence”, “casual basis”,
and “family member” have the same
meaning as those terms are defined in
Ohio Rev. Code Section 4111.14(D).
(b) “City” means the City of
Cleveland,
including
all
City
divisions, departments, and offices.
(c) “Covered employer” means any
person or entity employing 25 or more
employees in the United States during
the previous calendar year and who
otherwise meets the definition of
“employer” under Section 34a of
Article II of the Ohio Constitution.
(d) “Employee” has the same
meaning as in Ohio Rev. Code Section
4111.14 (B)(1), but does not include:
any individual employed by a solely
family owned and operated business,
who is a family member of one of the
owners; or any individual employed on
a casual basis in or about the property
of the employer or at the individual’s
residence.
Section 174.02 Required Minimum
Wage Rate
(a) Beginning January 1 following
the approval of this ordinance by the
voters, every covered employer shall
pay each of its employees working
within the geographical boundaries of
the City of Cleveland at a wage rate of
not less than $12.00 per hour; which
shall increase annually at a rate of
$1.00 per hour each subsequent
January 1, until the wage rate reaches
$15.00. Thereafter, the minimum wage
rate provided in this Chapter shall be
increased annually by the rate of
inflation for the twelve month period
prior to the September preceding the
required increase according to the
consumer price index or its successor
index for all urban wage earners and
clerical workers for all items as
calculated by the federal government
rounded to the nearest five cents.
(b) A covered employer is not
required to pay the minimum wage
rate established in this Chapter with
respect to an individual employee if:
(1) The employer has received a
license issued by the State of Ohio

The City Record
authorizing payment of a wage rate
below that required by Section 34a of
Article II of the Ohio Constitution to
employ the individual employee with
mental or physical disabilities that
may otherwise adversely affect their
opportunity for employment; or
(2) The employer can demonstrate
that an individual employee receives
tips that combined with the wages
paid by the employer are equal to or
greater than the minimum wage rate
for all hours worked. In such a case,
an employer may pay an employee
less than, but not less than half, the
minimum wage rate required by this
Chapter if the employee earns the
minimum wage rate established in
this Chapter for all hours worked
inclusive of tips.
Section 174.03 Prohibited Acts
(a) No covered employer shall pay
or agree to pay wages at a rate less
than the rate required by this Chapter.
Each week or portion thereof for
which the covered employer pays any
employee less than the rate required
by this Chapter constitutes a separate
offense.
(b) No covered employer shall
reduce the wage rate of any employee
as a consequence of this Chapter.
(c) No covered employer shall
discharge or in any other manner
discriminate against any employee
because the employee made any
complaint that the employee has not
been paid wages in accordance with
this Chapter, or because the employee
has or will cause any proceeding to be
instituted under or related to this
Chapter, or because the employee has
testified or is about to testify in any
proceeding related to this Chapter.
(d) No covered employer shall
otherwise violate any provision of this
Chapter. Each day of violation
constitutes a separate offense.
Section 174.04 Civil Actions
The City, an employee, or any
person acting on behalf of an
employee or all similarly-situated
employees may bring a civil action in
a court of competent jurisdiction for
such legal or equitable relief as may
be appropriate to remedy a violation of
Chapter 174, within three (3) years of
the violation or of when the violation
ceased if it was of a continuing nature.
There
shall
be
no
exhaustion
requirement, no procedural, pleading
or burden of proof requirements
beyond those that apply generally to
civil suits in order to maintain such
action and no liability for costs or
attorney’s fees on an employee except
upon a finding that such action was
frivolous in accordance with the same
standards that apply generally in civil
suits. Where a covered employer is
found to have violated any provision
of this Chapter, the covered employer
shall within thirty (30) days of the
finding pay the employee back wages,
damages, and the employee’s costs
and
reasonable
attorney’s
fees.
Damages shall be calculated as an
additional two times the amount of the
back wages and in the case of a
violation
of
an
anti-retaliation
provision an amount set by the court
sufficient to compensate the employee
and deter future violations, but not
less than one hundred fifty dollars for
each day that the violation continued.

1407

23
Payment under this paragraph shall
not be stayed pending any appeal.
Section 174.05 Effect
(a)
Nothing
in
this
Chapter
interferes with, impedes, or in any
way diminishes the right of employees
to bargain collectively with their
employers through representatives of
their own choosing in order to
establish wages or other conditions of
work in excess of the applicable
minimum wage rate established in
this Chapter.
(b) Nothing in chapter shall be
deemed to nor shall be applied in such
a
manner
so
as
to
have
a
constitutionally prohibited effect as
an ex post facto law or impairment of
an existing contract within the
meaning of the Ohio or federal
constitutions.
Section 174.06 Severability
If any portion of Chapter 174 is held
invalid, the remainder of the Chapter
shall not be affected by such holding
and shall continue in full force and
effect.
