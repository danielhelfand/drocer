Johnson, and Conwell
An emergency resolution strongly
objecting to the recent Presidential
Executive Order temporarily banning entry into the United States for
migrants from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from
around the world and joining with
all Americans who believe that the
Executive Order is unlawful and unAmerican and further, declaring
Cleveland, Ohio to be a “Welcoming
City” and calling upon the people of
Cleveland to join together to build
a stronger, united community.
Whereas, on Friday January 27,
2017, the President of the United
States issued an Executive Order
banning entry into the U.S. for
migrants and U.S. legal residents

Syria, Libya and Yemen, and for
migrants from across the globe; and

100

February 1, 2017

the U.S. to 50,000 persons for 2017,
when the United States historically
has led the world in the resettlement of refugees, accepting on average more than 79,000 refugees per
year for the last 42 years; and
Whereas, the U.N Refugee Agency
reports that children under the age
of 18 years old constitute 51% of
refugee population in 2015; and
Whereas, this Executive Order is
anathema to our shared values as a
nation of immigrants, a nation that
grants relief and safe haven to people from war-torn countries and
from religious, ethnic and all other
forms of persecution; and
Whereas, this ban enflames U.S.
relations with Muslim-majority countries, indeed with all Muslims, and
will surely make the United States
less safe from acts of terrorism; and
Whereas, in the United States, as
in Cleveland, our success depends on
making sure that all residents feel
welcome; and
Whereas, Cleveland always has
been and continues to be a welcoming city to everyone, including
immigrants who contribute economically and culturally to making our
city a better place; and
immigrants
and
Whereas,
refugees are a vital part of this city:
bringing fresh perspectives and new
ideas; starting businesses; and contributing to Cleveland’s treasured
and vibrant diversity; and
Whereas, this Council honors the
spirit of unity that brings neighbors
together and makes our community
the kind of place where diverse people from around the world feel valued and want to put down roots; and
Whereas, regardless of where we
are born or what we look like, we
are Cleveland residents united in
our efforts to build a stronger community; and
Whereas, this Council understands
that by recognizing the contributions that all of us make to create
a vibrant culture and a growing
economy, we make our city, and our
country, more prosperous and inclusive; and
Whereas, this Executive Order
violates the principles of the U.S.
Constitution; and these executive
orders promote dangerous public
policy, eroding the trust between
public safety agencies and the communities they serve, which ultimately undermine safety in the city
of Cleveland and across our country;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly objects to the Presidential
Executive Order temporarily banning entry into the United States for
migrants from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from
around the world and joins with all
Americans who believe that the
Executive Order is unlawful and unAmerican and further, this Council
declares Cleveland, Ohio to be a
“Welcoming City” and calls upon the
people of Cleveland to join together
to build a stronger, united community.

February 1, 2017
Section 2. That this Council strongly
resolves that the City of Cleveland is
under no obligation to be involved in
immigration
enforcement
federal
under protection of the Fourth and
Tenth Amendments of the U.S.
Constitution.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit a copy of this
resolution to the President of the
United States, Ohio Senators Rob
Portman and Sherrod Brown, Joe
Cimperman, President of Global
Cleveland and to the National League
of Cities.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it

Project Summary and Discussion
Hudson Holdings LLC (principals Avi Greenbaum and Steve Michael) are proposing an approximately $308 million
mixed-use project, HH Cleveland Huntington LP (“Project”). Hudson Holdings plans to revitalize the Huntington Building, with a mixed use redevelopment, encompassing retail, office, hotel and an apartment/condo product.
The project is located at the corner of East 9th Street and Euclid Avenue, one of the most prominent and central intersections in downtown Cleveland. Originally the Union Trust Building, and more recently the Huntington Building, the
Project has 1.3 million square feet and of that, 92% is currently vacant and in need of rehabilitation.
•

•

With approval, the plans for the redevelopment of the building include:
580 apartments
400,000 square feet of office space
200,000 square feet of banquet and retail space
60,000 square feet of incubator offices
93 live/work affordable micro-apartments to complement the incubator office space
274-room hotel

Developer
Hudson Holdings is deeply invested in commercial markets throughout the United States. Headquartered in Delray
Beach, FL, the company has a longstanding reputation as master planners, long-term investors, environmental stewards, and best-in-class managers of real estate. The principals of Hudson Holdings, Andrew Greenbaum and Steve
Michael, have bought and built over 4,000 residential units as well as over 3 million square feet of commercial space that
includes numerous dining and hospitality projects.
Proposed City Assistance:
The request to Cleveland City Council is to authorize the Director of Economic Development to enter into the chain of
title for certain properties associated with the project 925 Euclid redevelopment for the purpose of entering into a nonschool Tax Increment Finance (TIF) agreement with Hudson Holdings, LLC or its designee. These TIF funds will be
used to primarily finance construction for workforce housing and incubator space. This TIF agreement will be up to 30
years in length. The City will declare certain improvements with respect to the project to be a public purpose and exempt
100% of the improvements from real property taxes.
Under the agreement, parcels acquired and re-conveyed to the developer will be “TIFed” under section 5709.41 of the
Ohio Revised Code in consideration for the developer agreeing to make certain improvements to those parcels, and
agreeing to make payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT) equal to the taxes that would have been paid for those parcels but
for the TIF. A portion of the PILOT will be paid to the Cleveland Municipal School District in the amount the District
would have otherwise received but for the TIF.
This second piece of legislation is required by Cleveland City Council for approval of the TIF Agreement. The first
piece to allow the City to enter in to the chain of title was approved on June 6th, 2016.
Economic Impact
• 450 FTE ($29,000,000 annual salaries)
• 1000 estimated construction jobs (payroll estimated $93 Million)
• $1,057,069 City Income tax generated from estimated residents; additional $580,000 from new employees
• Once stabilized, the project is expected to generate approximately $1.65 million in property taxes for the School District annually and $1.63 million in parking, income, and residence taxes for the City and.
• Over the 30-year term of the TIF, the project is expected to generate approximately $49.5 Million in property taxes
for the School District, and $49 Million in parking, income, and residence taxes for the City.
