Purpose
The purpose of this document is to
identify the policy that will govern
the investment activities of the
Treasurer’s Office of the City of
Cleveland. This policy has been
adopted by, and, if necessary, will
be revised on an annual basis by,
the Director of Finance.
This policy is designed to ensure
prudent
management
of
public
funds, conformance to Chapter 178
of the Codified Ordinances of the
City of Cleveland, availability of
operating and capital funds when
needed, and an investment return
competitive with comparable funds
and financial market indices.
All participants in the investment
process shall act responsibly as custodians of the public trust. Investment officials shall recognize that
the investment portfolio is subject
to public review and evaluation. The
overall program shall be designed
and managed with a degree of professionalism that is worthy of the
public trust.

23
funds are available as needed
to meet those immediate and/or
future operating requirements
of the City of Cleveland.

3. Maximize Return – The Portfolio shall be managed in such a
fashion as to attain a marketaverage rate of return throughout budgetary and economic
cycles, within the context and
parameters set forth by objectives 1 and 2 above.
Delegation of Authority
The Treasurer is responsible for the
prudent investment of the City of
Cleveland Treasury and shall oversee the establishment of investment
procedures consistent with this policy. Such procedures shall include
explicit delegation of authority to
persons responsible for investment
transactions. No person may engage
in an investment transaction except
as provided under the terms of this
policy and the procedures established by the Treasurer. The Treasurer shall be responsible for all
trades undertaken, and shall establish a system of controls to regulate
the activities of subordinate officials and shall exercise control over
that staff. Investment staff shall be
bonded in amounts appropriate to
levels of responsibility and portfolio
characteristics.
The City’s Internal Auditor will
review the investment program to
ensure compliance with this policy.

Scope of the Investment Policy

Standard of Prudence

This policy applies to the investment of all moneys of the City of
Cleveland under the custody and/or
control of the Division of Treasury.
Any practice not clearly authorized
under this policy is prohibited. The
guidance set forth herein is to be
strictly followed by all those responsible for any aspect of the management or administration of these
funds.

The standard of prudence to be
applied to the investment of the City
of Cleveland shall be the industry
standard “Prudent Investor Rule”,
which states:

The City’s investments shall be segregated
into
distinct
portfolios,
including portfolios for the General
Fund, and the Divisions of Water,
Airport, Utilities, Cemeteries, Safety,
and Railroads. Total Average Portfolio, as defined in this policy, shall
mean the average of the month-end
market values for the prior twelve
(12) month period of an individual
portfolio.
The City of Cleveland bond proceeds
shall be invested in the eligible
securities as established by the
applicable bond indentures.

Investment Objectives
All Portfolios shall be managed to
accomplish the following hierarchy
of objectives:

1. Preservation of Principal – The
single most important objective
of the City of Cleveland investment program is the preservation of principal of those funds
within the Portfolio.
2. Maintenance of Liquidity – The
Portfolio shall be managed in
such a manner that assures that

495

“Investments shall be made
with judgment and care, under
circumstances
then
prevailing
which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise
in the management of their own
affairs, not for speculation, but
for investment, considering the
probable safety of their capital
as well as the probable income to
be derived.”
Treasury staff acting in accordance
with this policy or any other written procedures pertaining to the
administration and management of
the City of Cleveland and who exercise the proper due diligence shall
be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market price changes, provided that these deviations are
reported immediately to the Treasurer and that appropriate action is
taken to control and prevent any
further adverse developments.

Ethics and Conflict of Interest
Employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could
conflict with the proper execution
and management of the investment
program, or that could impair their
ability to make impartial decisions.
Further, no employee involved in
the investment process shall use the
authority to influence of office or
employment to secure anything of

24
value or the promise or offer of anything of value that would create an
improper influence upon the public
official or employee with respect to
that person’s duties.
Employees and investment officials
shall comply fully with the reporting and disclosure requirements of
Chapter 102 of the Ohio Revised
Code.

Authorized Instruments

Cleveland

unconditionally repurchase, any
of the securities listed in Section
178.12, divisions (b)(1), (b)(2), or
(b)(3), of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland.

Diversification
Each Portfolio shall be structured to
diversify investments to reduce the
risk of loss resulting from over-concentration of assets in a specific
maturity, a specific issuer or a specific type of security. The maximum
percentage of the Total Average
Portfolio permitted in each security
is as follows:
A. U.S. Treasury 100%
B. Federal Agency

(Callable)

Each Portfolio will be further diversified to limit the exposure to any

Repurchase Agreements

5% maximum

Monitoring and Adjusting the Portfolio
Those responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Portfolios will
routinely monitor the contents of
each Portfolio, the available markets and the relative values of competing instruments, and will adjust
each Portfolio as necessary to meet
the
investment
objectives
listed
above. It is recognized and understood
that
this
non-speculative
active
management
of
Portfolio
holdings may cause a loss on the
sale of an owned investment. It is
the policy of the City of Cleveland
to charge any such loss against the
interest income account during the
month in which the loss was realized.
The Division of Financial Reporting
& Control, on a monthly basis, allocates the net income/losses earned
on investments of pooled/commingled funds. The earnings are allocated based on each participating
fund’s cash balance in proportion to
total pooled/commingled cash.

Maximum Maturity

Internal Controls

Maintenance of adequate liquidity to
meet the cash flow needs of the City
is essential. Accordingly, each Portfolio will be structured in a manner
that ensures sufficient cash is available to meet anticipated liquidity
needs. Selection of investment maturities must be consistent with the
cash requirements in order to avoid
the forced sale of securities prior to
maturity.

The City Treasurer is responsible
for monitoring a system of internal
controls governing the administration and management of the Portfolio which include a review of all
investment activity, trade reconciliation, and targeting cash balances.
Such controls are designed to prevent and control losses of the City
funds arising from fraud, employee
error, misrepresentation by third
parties, unanticipated changes in
financial
markets,
or
imprudent
actions by any personnel. The internal controls address: control of collusion, separation of duties, separating transaction authority from
accounting and record keeping, custodial safekeeping, clear delegation
of authority, written confirmation of
telephone transactions, minimizing
the number of authorized investments officials and documentation
of investment transactions.

Assets will be invested in permitted
investments with a stated maturity
of no more than five (5) years from
the date of purchase unless the security is matched to a specific obligation or debt of the City. To control
the volatility of the assets, the Treasurer of the City will determine a
duration target, not to exceed three
(3) years.
Notwithstanding these limitations,
in no case will the assets in any
Portfolio be invested in securities
with
a
term
to
maturity
that
exceeds the expected disbursement
date of those funds.

Prohibited Investments and Investment Practices
The Treasurer is expressly prohibited from the following investments
and investment practices. This is
not an exclusive list.

496

Eligible Banks and Broker/Dealers
The Director of Finance will establish and the Treasurer will maintain
a list of eligible brokers, dealers,
and banks with which investment
transactions
can
be
made,
as
described in Section 178.11 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland. Qualified firms will be
limited to “primary” dealers and
other dealers that qualify under

April 5, 2017
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15C3-1 (uniform net capital rule) that are registered with
the Ohio Department of Commerce
to do business in the State of Ohio.
All financial institutions and broker
dealers must provide the following
information, on an annual basis:
1. Sworn statement pledging to
adhere to “Capital Adequacy
Standards”
2. Annual financial statements for
the most recent year showing
the amount of liquid capital
3. A written statement from a certified public accountant certifying no weakness in the internal
systems of controls of the dealer or broker were found
4. A
completed
“Broker/Dealer
Request for Information” and
all documentation required by
Section 178.12 of the Codified
Ordinances of the City of Cleveland.
Preference will be given to banks
and broker/dealers who are headquartered or maintain a presence in
the City of Cleveland.
Financial
institutions
and
broker/dealers will be required to
comply with this policy and to
pledge to offer for sale only appropriate securities.

Competitive Selection of Investment
Instruments
It will be the policy of the Treasurer to transact all security purchases/sales only with approved
financial institutions through a competitive process. The City shall
accept the offer which (a) has the
highest rate of return within the
maturity required; and (b) optimizes
the investment objective of the overall portfolio. When selling a security, the Treasurer will select the bid
that generates the highest sale
price.

The City Record
will be conducted on a delivery-vs.payment basis. The depository shall
issue a safekeeping receipt to the
Treasurer listing the specific instrument, rate, maturity and other pertinent information.
Appropriate Treasury officials and
representatives of the depository
responsible for, or in any manner
involved with, the safekeeping and
custody process of the City of Cleveland shall be bonded in such a fashion as to protect the City from losses from malfeasance and misfeasance.

Performance Standards
The investment portfolios shall be
designed and managed with the
objective of obtaining a market rate
of return throughout budgetary and
economic cycles, commensurate with
the investment risk constraints and
cash flows needs of the City.

Reporting
The City Treasury shall maintain
accurate,
complete,
and
timely
records of all investment activities.
Each business day, the Treasurer
shall provide the Commissioner of
Accounts and the City Controller a
sworn statement (Daily Treasurer’s
Report) showing the total amount
deposited in and withdrawn from
each depository from the preceding
business day. Within fifteen (15)
business days of the end of the
month, the City Treasurer shall submit an investment report to the
Director of Finance. This report
shall include: (i.) a listing of the
existing
portfolios
in
terms
of
investment securities, book value,
maturity date, return, market value,
and other features deemed relevant,
(ii.) a listing of all transactions executed during the month. The City
Treasurer will also prepare annual
reports in sufficient detail to provide full disclosure of all investment
activities to the Director of Finance.

Conflict of Law

Primary fixed price Federal Agency
offerings may be purchased from
the list of qualified broker/dealers
without competitive solicitation.

In the event that any portion of this
policy is in conflict with any City,
State, or Federal law, that law will
prevail.

In making investment decisions, all
other things being equal and subject
to compliance with any applicable
Internal Revenue Code requirements
for bond proceeds, investment in corporations and financial institutions
doing business in the City of Cleveland will be given preference over
other investment options.

Investment Policy Effective Date

Safekeeping and Custody
All investment securities purchased
by the Treasurer or held as collateral on deposits or investments shall
be held in third-party safekeeping at
the Federal Reserve Bank or at a
secured and insured depository as
required by Chapter 178 of the City
of Cleveland Codified Ordinance and
Section 113.05 of the Ohio Revised
Code.
All securities in the Portfolio shall
be held in the name of the Treasurer of the City of Cleveland and
will be free and clear of any lien.
Further, all investment transactions

This policy is adopted this 27th day
of March 2015 and shall remain in
effect until rescinded or amended by
the Director of Finance.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 279-17.
By Council Member Pruitt.
An emergency resolution approving the recommendation of the Operations Committee of the hiring of
certain employees by Cleveland City
Council.
Whereas, Section 31 of the Charter of the City of Cleveland mandates that the Council shall choose
“employees of its own body as are
necessary”; and
Whereas, under Rule 12-1 of the
Rules of Council, recommendation
for hiring will come through the
office of the Clerk to the Operations
Committee; and
Whereas,
such
recommendation
has been made to the Council and is
attached in File No. 279-17-A; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
approves the recommendation of the
Personnel and Operations Committee
of the hiring of hiring of certain
employees by Cleveland City Council, as listed in File No. 279-17-A.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force

Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code, the owners of the improvements may be required to make annual
service payments in lieu of taxes that would have been paid had the improvement not been exempt; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code, the exemption may exceed 75% of the improvements for up to 30

Project Summary and Discussion
515 Euclid Avenue LLC (“The Developer”) is proposing a new residential high-rise along the Euclid Corridor in downtown Cleveland. The property is owned by Euclid Avenue Garage, LLC and Samal Euclid LLC as tenants in common. The
proposed development, approximately $62.2 million with the acquisition of air rights, new construction, soft costs &
financing fees, will be built atop the existing 7-story, 524-space garage, located at 515 Euclid Avenue in downtown Cleveland. The garage was built in 2004. The developer is proposing to construct approximately 187 residential rental apartment units, a rooftop deck, an entertainment/social room and a built-in dog park as part of the project. New construction
involves adding 19 new residential floors atop the parking garage. The Beacon, when completed, will be a steel structure with approximately 28.5 stories including the garage with a height of 338 ft. The developer estimates Sixty percent
of the apartments will be one bedroom with the remainder being two bedroom units. The building will be LEED certified according to the City’s Green Building Code upon project completion.
Developer
The developer, 515 Euclid Avenue LLC, and/or Designee, is a joint venture with Bob Stark of Stark Enterprises and
Reuven Dessler, managing partner of the investor group that owns the 515 Euclid garage.
Proposed City Assistance:
The request to Cleveland City Council is to authorize the Director of Economic Development to enter Tax Increment
Financing (“TIF”) agreement with 515 Euclid Avenue LLC or designee. Parcels will be subject to a 41 TIF under section
5709.41 of the Ohio Revised Code in consideration for the developer agreeing to make certain improvements to those
parcels and agreeing to make payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT) equal to the taxes that would have been paid for those

will go through a trustee. This TIF agreement will be up to 30 years in length. The City will declare certain improvements with respect to the project to be a public purpose and exempt 100% of the improvements from real property taxes.
Under the agreement, parcels acquired and re-conveyed to the developer will be “TIFed” under section 5709.41 of the
Ohio Revised Code in consideration for the developer agreeing to make certain improvements to those parcels, and
agreeing to make payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT) equal to the taxes that would have been paid for those parcels but

would have otherwise received but for the TIF.
