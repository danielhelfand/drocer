is placed in File No. 171-17-A; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code , the improvements declared to be a public purpose may be exempt
from real property taxation; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code, the owners of the improvements may be required to make annual
service payments in lieu of taxes that would have been paid had the improvement not been exempt; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code, the exemption may exceed 75% of the improvements for up to 30
years when a portion of the service payments so collected are distributed to the Cleveland City School District (“District”) in an amount equal to the amount the District would have received had the improvement not been exempt; and
Whereas, the District has been notified of the intent to enter into the agreement authorized by this ordinance in compliance with Sections 5709.41(C)(4) and 5709.83 of the Revised Code; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a municipal
department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the improvements to be constructed by 515 Euclid Avenue, LLC, or its designee, (“Redeveloper”), are declared to be a public purpose for purposes of Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code. The Real Property
is more fully described as follows:

Project Summary and Discussion
515 Euclid Avenue LLC (“The Developer”) is proposing a new residential high-rise along the Euclid Corridor in downtown Cleveland. The property is owned by Euclid Avenue Garage, LLC and Samal Euclid LLC as tenants in common. The
proposed development, approximately $62.2 million with the acquisition of air rights, new construction, soft costs &
financing fees, will be built atop the existing 7-story, 524-space garage, located at 515 Euclid Avenue in downtown Cleveland. The garage was built in 2004. The developer is proposing to construct approximately 187 residential rental apartment units, a rooftop deck, an entertainment/social room and a built-in dog park as part of the project. New construction
involves adding 19 new residential floors atop the parking garage. The Beacon, when completed, will be a steel structure with approximately 28.5 stories including the garage with a height of 338 ft. The developer estimates Sixty percent
of the apartments will be one bedroom with the remainder being two bedroom units. The building will be LEED certified according to the City’s Green Building Code upon project completion.
Developer
The developer, 515 Euclid Avenue LLC, and/or Designee, is a joint venture with Bob Stark of Stark Enterprises and
Reuven Dessler, managing partner of the investor group that owns the 515 Euclid garage.
Proposed City Assistance:

Financing (“TIF”) agreement with 515 Euclid Avenue LLC or designee. Parcels will be subject to a 41 TIF under section

Under the agreement, parcels acquired and re-conveyed to the developer will be “TIFed” under section 5709.41 of the

agreeing to make payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT) equal to the taxes that would have been paid for those parcels but

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 173-17.
By Council Member J. Johnson.
An emergency resolution opposing
the proposed repeal of the Affordable Care Act because of the catastrophic impact such repeal would
have on millions of Americans who
currently rely on it for health insurance coverage.
Whereas, members of the United
States Congress have resolved to
repeal the Affordable Care Act
(ACA) in 2017; and
Whereas, repeal of the ACA would
be catastrophic for millions of Americans who currently rely on the ACA
for health insurance coverage for
themselves and their families; and
Whereas, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), if
the ACA were repealed, the number
of people in the United States who
are uninsured would increase by 18
million in the first new plan year
after the ACA is repealed; and
Whereas, also according to the
CBO, after elimination of the ACA’s
expansion of Medicaid eligibility
and of subsidies for insurance purchased through the ACA marketplaces, the number of uninsured
would increase to 27 million, and
then to 32 million uninsured by 2026;
and
Whereas, the CBO states that premiums for individual policies purchased through the marketplaces or
directly
from
insurers
would
increase by 20-25% in the first new
plan year after the ACA is repealed;
and
Whereas, in Ohio, by December,
2016, an estimated 212,000 people
enrolled in marketplace coverage
and nearly 690,000 Ohioans enrolled
in coverage as a result of the Medicaid expansion; and
Whereas, according to the U.S.
Census Bureau, under the ACA and
with the expansion of Medicaid,
between 2013 and 2015, the number
of uninsured Ohio adults fell from
11% to 6.5%; and
Whereas, repeal of the ACA would
mean the slashing of federal funds
flowing to Ohio’s state budget, to its
health care providers and to Ohio
families who benefit from expanded
coverage;
further,
repeal
would
adversely impact the job security of
thousands of health care workers in
Cleveland and northeast Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the proposed repeal of the Affordable Care Act because of the catastrophic impact such repeal would
have on millions of Americans who
currently rely on it for health insurance coverage.

Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to the President of the
United States, all members of the U.S.
Congress and all members of the Ohio
legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
