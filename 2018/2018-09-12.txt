Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances are supplemented by enacting new Sections 341.051, 341.052,
341.053, and 509.21 to read as follows:

situated on one (1) or more acres of
land, and for apartment, townhome
or condominium projects of four (4)
or more units situated on any size

The City Record
of all existing trees on the property; (2) the intent to preserve, relocate, or replace each tree; (3) measures to be taken to protect new and

Section 341.052 Tree Preservation
General Requirements
The following are basic provisions
for the preservation of private and
public trees during construction of
development projects on one (1) or
more acres of land, for apartment,
townhome or condominium projects
of four (4) or more units situated on
any size parcel of land, and for protecting public trees under Section
509.14.
(a) All trees with a DBH of over
six (6) inches shall be preserved,
maintained and protected during
construction, a tree’s roots shall be
protected, and the size of the Tree
Protection Zone shall be, in accordance with Best Management Standards
and
ANSI
Standards
for
Arboriculture, as may be amended
from time to time.
(b) Trees on the property shall
not be removed without prior written approval from the Commissioner
of Park Maintenance and Properties
(Commissioner) or a designee and
only if one (1) or more of the following situations apply:
(1) The tree poses a risk. To verify that a risk exists, the City may
require a tree risk assessment be
performed by the Commissioner or
designee or an International Society
of
Arboriculture
(ISA)-Certified
Arborist with the ISA qualification.
(2) The tree is planted too close
to an existing structure, such that it
is either damaging or has the clear
potential to damage the structure.
(3) The tree inhibits an infrastructure repair due to its proximity to the needed infrastructure
repair. Trees should not be removed
simply because a sidewalk is raised
or cracked, because the removal of
the tree will not repair the damage.

1545

15
(4) The tree has structural defects
(eg., split trunk, poor branch attachments), is damaged to the point that
it cannot recover and grow properly, or that it will grow in a misshapen or unsightly manner that
could result in failure.
(5) The tree is infested with an
epidemic insect or disease where the
recommended control is not applicable and removal is necessary to prevent transmission of the insect or
disease to other trees. The City may
require this condition to be verified
by the Commissioner or designee or
an ISA-Certified Arborist.
(6)
The
Commissioner
or
a
designee
determines
that
the
removal of the tree is necessary to
carry out construction in compliance
with approved plans.
(7) A person, firm or corporation
may appeal the decision whether to
remove a tree to the Commissioner
within 10 business days of the date
of the notice of the decision. The
Commissioner shall have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse or modify the
decision and shall do so within 10
days of the date of the appeal. A
person aggrieved by a final decision
of the Commissioner may further
appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals within thirty (30) days
after the Commissioner’s decision.
(c) A tree that is removed shall
be replaced with a tree of appropriate species as selected by the Commissioner or designee and in a location where it will grow to replace
the removed tree without posing the
risks
for
which
the
tree
was
removed. Instead of replacing a tree
removed pursuant to this section, a
developer may reimburse the City
the value of the tree as established
using the Trunk Formula Method
outlined in The Guide for Plant
Appraisal by the Council of Tree
and Landscape Appraisers, as may
be amended from time to time, or
other tree replacement analysis provided by similar publication. All
funds collected pursuant to this division shall be deposited in the Tree
Preservation
Fund
established
under Chapter 509 of the Codified
Ordinances.
Section 341.053 Civil Penalties for
Damaged Trees or Trees Removed
Without Approval
(a) Any person, firm, or corporation required to submit a Tree
Preservation Plan that damages a
tree located in the development site,
due to the failure to properly protect or maintain the tree during construction pursuant to Section 341.052,
whether by negligence or otherwise,
shall be charged one thousand dollars ($1000.00) per area of damage
to the above ground portion of the
tree. If the damage can be repaired
or reduced following Best Management Standards and ANSI Standards
for Arboriculture, as may be amended from time to time, the party
responsible for the damage shall
hire an ISA-Certified Arborist to
repair or reduce the damage at the
cost of the responsible party. If the
damage to the tree is adequately
repaired
by
the
ISA-Certified
Arborist, in the discretion of the
Commissioner of Park Maintenance
and Properties (Commissioner) or
designee, the Commissioner may
waive the civil fine.

16
(b) Any person, firm, or corporation required to submit a Tree
Preservation Plan that harms a tree
within the development site by failing to properly protect the roots in
violation of Section 341.052 or division (e) of Section 352.05, such that
an ISA-Certified Arborist believes
the tree will fall or decline and die
within two (2) calendar years of the
date of completion of construction,
shall be charged the full value of
the tree as established using the
Trunk Formula Method outlined in
The Guide for Plant Appraisal by
the Council of Tree and Landscape
Appraisers, as may be amended
from time to time, or other tree
replacement analysis provided by
similar publication.
(c) Any person, firm or corporation required to submit a Tree
Preservation Plan that removes any
tree located in the development site
in violation of Section 341.052, shall
be charged a civil fine of $1,000 for

full cost of any removed tree based
on the replacement cost of the tree
as established using the Trunk Formula Method outlined in The Guide
for Plant Appraisal by the Council
of Tree and Landscape Appraisers,
as may be amended from time to
time, or other tree replacement
analysis provided by similar publication.

may further appeal to the Board of
Zoning Appeals within thirty (30)
days after the Commissioner’s decision.

violation of, or to adhere to, applicable sections of this Code, shall be
deposited in the Tree Preservation
Fund for disbursement as set forth
in this section.

Section 352.05 Requirements for
All Landscaped Areas
(a) Permitted Forms of Screening.
Screening required in item 2 of the
table contained in Section 352.11 and
the Screen Barrier required in the
table contained in Section 352.10
may take the form of:
(1) A landscaped earthen berm;
(2) A concrete or masonry wall;
(3) A wood, wrought iron, tubular
steel, or similar decorative fence as
approved by the Director of the City
Planning Commission as compatible
with the character of the area in
which the fence is to be placed;
(4) A compact hedge or other live
evergreen vegetative barrier; or
(5) A combination thereof.
Fences and walls used to meet
screening requirements shall display a finished face toward adjacent
streets and properties.
(b) Types of Landscaping Materials. As determined by the Commissioner of Parks and Urban Forestry
Park Maintenance and Properties
(Commissioner) or a designee, or in
accordance with standards promulgated by said the Commissioner or
designee, all varieties of living landscape materials used shall be:
(1) Healthy, hardy, and droughtresistant consistent with the availability of water for artificial irrigation; and
(2) Suitable for the climate and
environmental influences on the
site, such as exposure to sun, wind,
water,
heat,
automobile
exhaust
fumes, and road salt; and
(3) Compatible with the slope of
the site, with existing vegetation to
be preserved and with utility lines
above or below ground level; and
(4) Tree selection shall be based
on recommended species in the
Cleveland Tree Plan as it may be
amended from time to time. Not
prone to cause a nuisance within the
public right-of-way as a result of
dropping fruit or debris other than
leaves. Where vulnerable to damage, materials shall be protected
from pedestrian or vehicular traffic
by grates, pavers or other measures.
(c) Ground Cover In Landscaped
Strips. Grass or other ground cover
shall be planted over all landscaped
strips including earthen faces of
berms, except in areas planted in
flowers, shrubs, or trees, so as to
present a finished appearance and
reasonably complete coverage within three (3) months after planting.
Non-living landscaping materials
such as sand, stones, rocks, or barks
may be substituted for living cover
over a maximum of thirty percent
(30%) of the landscaped area. No
artificial plants or turf shall be
used.
(d) Preservation of Landscaping.
(1) Credit Toward Requirements.
The Commissioner Director of Building and Housing, in consultation
with the Commissioner or designee,
shall credit healthy trees or shrubs
existing on a site prior to development and proposed to be preserved
toward the requirements of the table
contained in Section 352.11.

The City Record
Except as provided herein for
bonus credits, each preserved tree or
shrub
meeting
the
applicable
requirements of the table contained
in Section 352.11 shall reduce by one
(1) the number of new trees or
shrubs required.
(2) Bonus Credit for Larger Trees.
Larger preserved trees shall reduce
the number of new trees required in
the table contained in Section 352.11
as follows:
Trunk Caliper of
Existing Tree to
be Preserved*

Reduction in
Number of
New Trees
Required
8 - 16 inches
2 trees
Over 16 inches
3 trees
* Measured 4.5 feet above grade at
base.

(e) Tree Protection During Construction. An applicant claiming
may claim a credit for preservation
of existing trees and shrubs under
division (d) of this section, Section
352.05 and shall certify that all trees
and shrubs for which a credit is
claimed are currently healthy. An
applicant
shall
adhere
to
the
requirements of this section with
respect to all trees on the site,
including the trees for which the
credit is claimed. shall file with the
Commissioner of Park and Urban
Forestry a written statement certifying that all trees and shrubs are
currently
healthy
and
that
the
requirements of division (e) of Section 352.05 will be adhered to with
respect to the trees for which the
credit is claimed.
(1) Tree protection during construction, including bark and root
protection, shall be according to
Best Management Standards and
ANSI Standards for Arboriculture as
may be amended from time to time.
(1)
Mechanical
and
Chemical
Injury. Because mechanical injuries
to trees intended to be preserved
can be caused by soil compaction,
unnecessary cutting of roots, fire,
collisions with heavy equipment,
carelessness with tools, and girdling
with guy wires, and chemical injury
caused by solvents, thinners, paints,
oils, and other materials, protective
barriers are required as described
herein.
A. Enclosure of Drip Line Area. A
fence, roping, flagging, or other protective barrier shall enclose the area
within the drip line or lines, and
any exposed roots outside of such
line or lines, of each tree or group
of trees proposed for preservation.
Such barrier shall be visible enough
to be seen easily by equipment operators.
Removal of brush and weeds within this barrier shall be performed
with hand tools only. To avoid
chemical damage to trees, equipment shall not be cleaned within the
barrier.
No equipment materials, fill, or
debris shall be stored within the
barrier except as may be necessary
for a reasonable time if no other
storage area is available.
B. Bark Protection. Trunks of
trees to be preserved that surround
the immediate building site and border access roads shall be wrapped
with sections of snow fence or
boards wired together.
No nails or spikes shall be driven
into trees to be preserved, nor shall

1547

17
such trees be used for signs, fencing, roping, or cables.
(2)
Grade
Changes.
Because
changing the grade of the land surrounding a tree can impair the ability of its roots to obtain necessary
amounts of air, water, and land minerals, protective measures shall be
taken as specified in this division.
A. Raising of Grade. Before the
grade of the land around a tree to
be preserved is raised by land filling, the party undertaking the grading shall:
1. Install an aeration system consisting of a dry well around the
trunk together with a layer of gravel and stone and a system of drain
tiles over the root system at the
level of the original grade. Such system shall be configured to provide,
in the judgment of the Commissioner of Park and Urban Forestry, adequate air and water circulation and
drainage of water away from the
trunk; or
2. If an aeration system is impractical or financially infeasible, take
other measures approved by the
Commissioner of Park and Urban
Forestry to protect the tree.
B. Exemption. Fills are exempt
from the requirements of this division if they:
1. Are six (6) inches or less in
depth; and
2. Consist only of porous, loamy,
or gravelly soil high in organic matter; and
3. Do not contain clay, marl, or
other heavy, impervious fills of any
depth.
C. Lowering of Grade. To protect
trees intended to be preserved from
removal of or damage to feeder
roots or changes to the water table,
the area within the drip line shall
be separated from the lowered grade
by either terracing or, for grade differences of less than two (2) feet,
construction of a dry retaining wall.
(3) Excavations.
A. Location. Excavations for utility pipelines shall be routed within
the drip line of a tree to be preserved only if in the judgment of
the Commissioner Parks and Urban
Forestry:
1. No other route for the lines
bypassing the root area is practical;
and
2. Tunneling under the roots with
a power-driven soil augur is impractical or financially infeasible in
relation to the value of the tree.
B. Root Protection. Parties excavating within the root area shall:
1. Minimize the number of roots
cut, especially of large main roots;
and
2. Cleanly cut with proper tools
such roots as must be cut and retrim
them after excavation; and
3. Paint cuts of roots of onefourth (1/4) inch diameter or larger
with a wound dressing like orange
shellac or asphalt-based paint; and
4. Backfill the trench as soon
after excavation as possible to minimize the time roots are exposed to
the air; and
5. Leave no pockets of air when
back filling; and
6. Mix peat moss with fill soil to
promote new growth.
(4)
(2)
Damage
Mitigation.
Where, d Despite the foregoing provisions following Best Management
Standards and ANSI Standards for
Arboriculture, as may be amended

18
from time to time, significant damage has been done to the roots, the
tree may need to be removed based
on the assessment by the Commissioner or a designee. In this case,
the owner shall replace the tree
with a tree or trees of equal or
greater diameter that are approved
by the Commissioner or a designee,
or the owner shall make payment to
the City’s Tree Preservation Fund
for the replacement cost of the tree
as established using the Trunk Formula Method outlined in The Guide
for Plant Appraisal by the Council
of Tree and Landscape Appraisers,
as may be amended from time to
time, or other tree replacement
analysis provided by similar publication. shall be fertilized and excess
branches that cannot be supported
by the remaining undamaged roots
shall be pruned.
Tree limbs damaged during construction shall be addressed following Best Management Standards and
ANSI Standards for Arboriculture, as
may be amended from time to time.
sawed off flush to the trunk.
(5) (3) Removal of Barriers. Protective fences and barriers around
trees shall be removed only as the
final
stage
of
post-construction
cleanup.
(f)
Berming. Berms used for
screening shall be a minimum of
two (2) feet high at all points. The
interior face of a berm may be
retained by a wall, terrace, or other
means acceptable to the Commissioner Director of Building and
Housing in lieu of taking the form
of an earthen slope.
All earthen berm faces on which
ground cover is not yet completely
established shall be protected from
erosion by a mulch and/or an erosion control net.
Slopes for earthen faces shall not
exceed thirty- three percent (33%) if
covered with grass and fifty percent
(50%) if covered with other vegetative cover.
(g) Curbing. All landscaped strips
located in or abutting parking areas
shall be separated on all sides from
the parking surface by curbing consisting of concrete, stone, brick,
asphalt, or other material approved
by the Commissioner Director of
Building and Housing as having
comparable appearance and durability. Curbing shall be in good condition upon installation.

and curbing required under this
chapter so as to preserve at least
the same quantity, quality, and
screening effectiveness as initially
installed.
A preserved existing tree to which
a bonus credit was applied that dies
or is destroyed shall be replaced by
