Ordinance No. 534-17, passed by the
Cleveland City Council on May 15, 2017,
Board of Control Resolution No. 296-17,
adopted June 14, 2017, authorized the
Director of Finance to enter into
contract with TruePoint Solutions, LLC

enhance the City’s Accela software;
and
Whereas, Resolution No. 296-17
stated a not-to-exceed fee for each
year of the term for the above-mentioned services by TruePoint Solutions, LLC; and
Whereas, because TruePoint Solutions, LLC will perform services as
needed during the term generally to
implement and enhance Accela software for various departments and
divisions of the City, and the contract term was inadvertently omitted from the Resolution No. 296-17,
and because the approximate annual fees stated in the resolution do
not necessarily reflect the actual
fees to be incurred for TruePoint
Solutions’ services, the City desires
to amend Resolution No. 296-17 to
state more specifically the nature of
the engagement of TruePoint Solutions and its fees; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Board of
Control of the City of Cleveland that
Resolution No. 296-17, adopted by
this Board June 14, 2017, authorizing the Director of Finance to enter
into contract with TruePoint Solutions, LLC for professional services
necessary to enhance the City’s
Accela software is amended as follows:
In the first paragraph, the last
three lines are amended to read “the
firm to be employed by contract for
a term of 2 years to supplement the
regularly employed staff of several
departments of the City of Cleveland
to perform the professional application design, maintenance, upgrade
and support services necessary to
implement and enhance the City’s
Accela software”.
In the second paragraph, lines 4
and 5 are amended to read: “for the
fees set forth in the fee schedule
included in TruePoint Solutions’ fee
proposal, and”.
Be it further resolved that all
other provisions of Resolution No.
296-17 not expressly amended above
shall remain unchanged and in full
force and effect.
