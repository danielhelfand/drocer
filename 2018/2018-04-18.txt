RESOLUTIONS REFERRED
Res. No. 464-18.
By Council Member Polensek.
An emergency resolution supporting House Bill 560 to prohibit pet
food from containing remains from
an animal that was euthanized by

the use of any drug injected intravenously or through another nonvascular route or remains from any dog
or cat.
Whereas, currently, it is legal in
Ohio for dog and cat remains to be
put into pet food; and
Whereas, the euthanizing drug
pentobarbital has turned up in pet

563

food and some veterinarians have
reported animals getting sick from
eating it; and
Whereas, for years, veterinarians
have reported that it is harder to
put down an animal, which may be
because some have built up a resistance to the pentobarbital that is in
the pet food because it is in the

6
euthanized animals used to make
the pet food; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland
Section 1. That this Council supports House Bill 560 to prohibit pet
food from containing remains from
an animal that was euthanized by
the use of any drug injected intravenously or through another nonvascular route or remains from any

Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to all members of the Ohio legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

Res. No. 472-18.
By Council Member Kazy.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Senate to pass House Bill
38 to provide that purposely causing
the death of a first responder or military member is aggravated murder,
and to require an offender to serve
a mandatory prison term for certain
types
of
felonious
assault
or
attempted aggravated murder when
the victim is a first responder or
military member.
Whereas, House Bill 38, sponsored
by Representative David Greenspan,
was passed by the Ohio House of
Representatives on May 17, 2017,
and is pending passage in the Ohio
Senate after several hearings; and
Whereas, House Bill 38 expands
the offense of aggravated murder to
also include purposely causing the
death of a first responder or military member whom the offender
knows is a first responder or military member and it is the offender’s
specific purpose to kill a person in
that capacity; and
Whereas, the bill expands the
offense of aggravated murder based
on purposely causing the death of a
law enforcement officer whom the
offender knows or has reasonable
cause to know is such an officer to
also apply when the victim is a federal law enforcement officer or a
person who previously served in
either capacity; and
Whereas, House Bill 38 requires a
mandatory prison term of three to
11 years for an attempt to commit
aggravated murder of the type
described in either of the two preceding clauses; and
Whereas, it also increases the
penalty for felonious assault against
a first responder or military member from a second degree felony,
absent any specification, to a first
degree felony if the offender specifically targeted the victim for being
a first responder or military member; and
Whereas,
the
bill
requires
a
mandatory prison term of three to
11
years
for
felonious
assault
against a first responder or military
member if the offender specifically

The City Record
targeted the victim for being a first
responder or military member and
the victim suffered serious physical
harm; and
Whereas, lastly, House Bill 38 provides that the first degree felony
penalty for felonious assault against
a peace officer or BCII investigator,
and the three to 11-year mandatory
prison term that applies when such
a victim suffers serious physical
harm, also apply when the victim is
a federal law enforcement officer or
a person who previously served in
any of those capacities; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the need for justice for first responders and military members who are
purposefully killed; therefore we
urge the Ohio Senate to pass House
Bill 38; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio Senate to pass House Bill
38 to provide that purposely causing
the death of a first responder or military member is aggravated murder,
and to require an offender to serve

the victim is a first responder or

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 393-18.
By Council Member Griffin.
An emergency resolution calling
upon the Ohio legislature to pass
Ohio S.B. 278 providing a “red flag”
law that would allow the seizure of
guns before a person can commit an
act of violence against self or others.
Whereas, currently there is an
innovative law enacted in at least
five states known as the “red flag”
law that allows law enforcement to
seize guns from individuals determined to be a threat to themselves
or others which Ohio S.B. 278 will
similarly follow if passed ; and
Whereas, “red flag” laws and
“extreme risk protection orders” in
California,
Washington,
Oregon,
Indiana and Connecticut can be
used by family members or law
enforcement to ask a judge for a
“gun
violence
restraining
order”
based on someone’s violent or troubling behavior; and
Whereas, in Connecticut between
1999-2013, researchers found that
police served 762 risk warrants,
about 50 instances per year, and

The City Record
estimated that a gun suicide was
prevented for every 10-20 seizures;
police found guns in 99% of the
cases in which they served warrants
and seized an average of 7 firearms
from each person; and
Whereas, removal of the gun via
a “red flag” law is limited and targeted toward specific individuals
and would create opportunities for
more social services to address mental health and other safety issues;
and
Whereas, 18 other states, including Florida and the District of
Columbia have proposed “red flag”
laws; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland
Section 1. That this Council hereby calls upon the Ohio legislature to
enact pass Ohio S.B. 278 providing a
“red flag” law that would allow the
seizure of guns before a person can
commit an act of violence against
self or others.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to Governor John
Kasich and to all members of the
Ohio legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted April 9, 2018.
Effective April 10, 2018.
