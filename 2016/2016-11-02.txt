a moratorium on the review and
issuance of zoning permits, certificates of occupancy, and other license
or permit applications that would
enable cultivators, processors and
retail dispensaries of medical marijuana in the City of Cleveland.
Whereas, Substitute House Bill 523,
which legalizes the cultivation, processing and retail dispensing of medical marijuana in Ohio became effective on September 8, 2016; and
Whereas, among other things, this
bill permits patients in Ohio to use
medical marijuana on the recommendation of physicians; creates state
regulatory oversight of the cultivation, processing, retail sale, use and
physician recommendation of medical
marijuana; and prohibits a cultivator,
processor, retail dispensary or laboratory from locating or relocating within 500 feet of a school, church, public
library, public playground or public
park; and
Whereas, Substitute House Bill 523
further authorizes the legislative
authority of a municipality to adopt
regulations to prohibit or limit the
number of medical marijuana cultivators, processors or retail dispensaries
located within its borders; and
Whereas, this Council requires time
to review all applicable state and
local laws to make recommendations
on possible zoning prohibitions and
limitations of the cultivation, processing and retail sale of medical marijuana, to determine compatibility
with the city’s land use plans and
their effects on surrounding land
uses, and to maintain the public
health, safety and welfare; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
property, health, safety, or welfare in

issuance of zoning permits, certificates of occupancy, and other license
or permit applications for medical
marijuana-related businesses including cultivators, processors, and retail
dispensaries is necessary to enable
this Council to consider all relevant
factors in order to make a determination as to what action is appropriate
for the City; now therefore,

City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, for the reasons stated in the preamble to this ordinance,

same meanings as in Substitute
House Bill 523 and Chapter 3796 of the
Revised Code.

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
