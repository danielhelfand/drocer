passed October 24, 2016, relating to one
or more contracts with SoundCom
Systems for professional services
necessary to maintain and support the
audio paging sound system for the
Department of Port Control.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 1 of Ordinance No. 1028-16, passed October 24,
2016, is amended to read as follows:
Section 1. That the Director of Port

2016, in the sum of $49,583.00 for the
initial term, for the Department of
Port Control, for a period of one year
with three one-year options to renew.
The first of the one-year options to
renew may be exercised by the
Director of Port Control, without the
necessity of obtaining additional
authority of this Council. The second
of the one-year options to renew may
not be exercised without additional
legislative
authority.
If
such
additional legislative authority is
granted and the second of the one-year
options to renew is exercised, then the
third of the one-year options to renew

Director of Port Control, without the
necessity of obtaining additional

and,

An emergency ordinance approving
the Northeast Ohio Public Energy
Council Electric Plan of Operation &
Governance for the City of Cleveland’s
electric aggregation program.
Whereas, Section 4928.20 of the
Revised Code permits a municipality to create a retail electric aggregation program and thereby combine the electricity loads of its residents and small commercial customers for the purpose of seeking
sources of electricity for such customers; and
Whereas, on November 7, 2000, the
electors of the City of Cleveland
voted to authorize such a program
in the City; and
Whereas, under division (C) of
Section 4928.20 of the Revised Code,
the legislative authority or board of
a municipality developing an automatic
aggregation
program
is
required to adopt a plan of operation and governance for its municipal aggregation program; and
Whereas, this Council previously
enacted legislation authorizing the
City to join the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council (“NOPEC”) electric aggregation program to enable
the City to act jointly with other
member political subdivisions and
maximize any benefits of electricity
deregulation through group purchasing efforts; and
Whereas, on behalf of this Council under Section 4928.20 of the
Revised Code, two public hearings
have been held on the Plan of Operation
and
Governance
for
the
NOPEC electric aggregation program; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council adopts
the plan substantially in the form of
the NOPEC Plan of Operation & Governance contained in Council File
No. 444-17-A for the implementation

declared to be an emergency measure
and,
provided
it
receives
the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all

Whereas, under Section 4928.20 of
the Revised Code, the City of Cleveland, Ohio (the “City”) is authorized
to
establish
an
opt-out
electric

of eligible electric customers located within the City; and
Whereas,
under
R.C.
Section
4928.20, the City may exercise such
authority jointly with other political
subdivisions in the State of Ohio;
and
Whereas, governmental aggregation provides an opportunity for the
City to combine the electric loads of
its residents and small commercial
customers and offer electrical customers the ability to participate in
any benefits of electric deregulation; and
Whereas, through Ordinance No.
799-03, passed June 2, 2003, the City
entered into a membership agreement with the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council (“NOPEC”); and
Whereas, the City seeks to participate in the NOPEC electric supply
aggregation
program
established for the benefit of its member
communities; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council finds
and determines that it is in the best
interest of the City of Cleveland,
and certain electric customers within the City, to participate in the optout electric aggregation program
offered by NOPEC, on the basis of
the NOPEC proposal dated March 9,
2017, which is placed in File No. 44517-A.
Section 2. That the Director of

(1) When overtaking and passing
another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction, or when making a
left turn under the rules governing
those movements;
(2) When an obstruction exists
making it necessary to drive to the
left of the center of the highway;
provided, any person so doing shall
yield the right-of-way to all vehicles
traveling in the proper direction
upon the unobstructed portion of the
highway within such distance as to
constitute an immediate hazard;
(3) When driving upon a roadway
divided into three (3) or more
marked lanes for traffic under the

vehicle or trackless trolley proceeding at less than the prevailing and
lawful speed of traffic at the time
and place and under the conditions
then existing shall be driven in the
right-hand lane then available for
traffic, and far enough to the right
to allow passing by faster vehicles
if the passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following circumstances:
A. When overtaking and passing
another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
B. When preparing for a left turn;
C. When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the

vehicle proceeding in the same
direction shall, except as provided
in division (a)(3) of this section,
signal to the vehicle or trackless
trolley to be overtaken, shall pass
to the left thereof at a safe distance,
and shall not again drive to the
right side of the roadway until safely clear of the overtaken vehicle or
trackless trolley. When a motor
vehicle or trackless trolley overtakes and passes a bicycle, three
feet or greater is considered a safe
passing distance.
(2) Except when overtaking and
passing on the right is permitted,
the operator of an overtaken vehicle
shall give way to the right in favor
of the overtaking vehicle at the latter's audible signal, and the operator shall not increase the speed of

oncoming traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to permit such overtaking and passing to be completely made, without interfering with
the safe operation of any traffic
approaching from the opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In
every event the overtaking vehicle
or trackless trolley must return to
an authorized lane of travel as soon
as practicable, and in the event the
passing movement involves the use
of a lane authorized for traffic
approaching from the opposite direction before coming within two hundred (200) feet of any approaching
vehicle.
(RC 4511.29)
Section 431.06 Additional Restrictions on Driving upon Left Side of
Roadway
(a) No vehicle or trackless trolley
shall be driven upon the left side of
the roadway under the following
conditions:
(1) When approaching the crest of
a grade or upon a curve in the highway, where the operator’s view is

Section 431.07 Hazardous or No
Passing Zones
(a) Hazardous zones, commonly
called “no passing zones,” shall consist of an auxiliary yellow line
marked on the roadway pavement
and placed parallel to the normal
center line or marked lane line.
When the auxiliary yellow line
appears on the left side in the driver’s lane of travel and to the right
of the normal center line or marked
lane line, no driver shall drive
across the auxiliary yellow line to
overtake and pass another vehicle
proceeding in the same direction.
When auxiliary yellow lines appear
on both sides of the normal center
line or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction shall not

April 26, 2017
drive across such auxiliary yellow
lines to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same
direction. No driver shall, at any
other time, drive across the yellow
auxiliary line when it appears in
the driver’s lane of travel, except to
make a lawfully permitted left-hand
turn under the rules governing such
movement. No passing signs may
also be erected facing traffic to indicate the beginning and end of each
no passing zone.
(b) The department of transportation may determine those portions of
any state highway where overtaking and passing other traffic or driving to the left of the center or center line of the roadway would be
especially hazardous and may, by
appropriate signs or markings on
the highway, indicate the beginning
and end of such zones. When signs
or markings are in place and clearly visible, every operator of a vehicle or trackless trolley shall obey
the directions of the signs or markings, notwithstanding the distances
set out in RC 4511.30 and in Section
431.06.

following apply:
(1) The slower vehicle is proceeding at less than half the speed
of the speed limit applicable to that
location.
(2) The faster vehicle is capable
of overtaking and passing the slower vehicle without exceeding the
speed limit.
(3) There is sufficient clear sight
distance to the left of the center or
centerline of the roadway to meet
the overtaking and passing provisions of Section 431.05 and RC
4511.29, considering the speed of the
slower vehicle.

moved from such lane or line until
the driver has first ascertained that
such movement can be made with
safety.
(2) Upon a roadway which is
divided into three (3) lanes and provides for two (2) way movement of
traffic, a vehicle or trackless trolley
shall not be driven in the center
lane except when overtaking and
passing another vehicle or trackless
trolley where the roadway is clearly visible and such center lane is
clear of traffic within a safe distance, or when preparing for a left
turn, or where such center lane is
at the time allocated exclusively to
traffic moving in the direction the
vehicle or trackless trolley is proceeding and is posted with signs to
give notice of such allocation.
(3) Official signs may be erected
directing specified traffic to use a
designated
lane
or
designating
those lanes to be used by traffic
moving in a particular direction,

The City Record
regardless of the center of the roadway, or restricting the use of a particular lane to only buses during
certain hours or during all hours,
and drivers of vehicles or trackless
trolleys shall obey the directions of
such signs.

trackless trolley, and the traffic
upon and the condition of the highway.
(b) The driver of any truck, or
motor vehicle drawing another vehicle, when traveling upon a roadway
outside a business or residence district shall maintain a sufficient
space, whenever conditions permit,
between such vehicle and another
vehicle ahead so an overtaking
motor vehicle may enter and occupy
such space without danger. This
paragraph does not prevent overtaking and passing nor does it
apply to any lane specially designated for use by trucks.
(c) Outside a municipal corporation, the driver of any truck, or
motor vehicle when drawing another vehicle, while ascending to the
crest of a grade beyond which the
driver's view of a roadway is

By Council Member Polensek.
An emergency resolution objecting to a New C1 Liquor Permit at

Liquor Permit at 185 Gas, Inc., 1201

44119, Permit Number 6548391; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Superintendent of Liquor Control within 30
days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to a New C2
Liquor Permit at 185 Gas, Inc., 1201
East 185th Street, Cleveland, Ohio
44119, Permit Number 6548391; and
requests
the

resolution, together with two copies of
a letter of objection and two copies of
