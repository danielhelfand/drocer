An emergency ordinance declaring
a moratorium on the issuance of $100
tickets for infractions related to setting out excessively large quantities
of waste for collection in the City of
Cleveland until authorization is
reestablished by Council; this moratorium does not extend to the issuance
of tickets in the amount of $350 for
setting out super-excessive amounts
of solid waste.
Whereas, section 551.991 authorizes
the Director of Public Works to issue
a ticket for $100 to the responsible
party who commits a violation of,
inter alia, section 551.111 divisions
(a) and (b), which prohibit setting
out a quantity of waste exceeding
five (5) approved waste containers,
twenty (20) bags of yard waste, twenty (20) bundles of brush or tree
trunks, four (4) tires, or three (3) special waste items in either a manual
collection zone or an automated collection zone; and
Whereas, section 551.991 also authorizes the Director of Public Works to
issue a ticket for $350 to the responsible party if the quantity of solid
waste exceeds ten (10) approved
waste containers, forty (40) bags of
yard waste, forty (40) bundles of
brush or tree trunks, eight (8) tires,
or six (6) special waste items; and
Whereas, this Council has received
countless complaints from residents
who are being given $100 tickets for
violating section 551.111 even when
the quantity of waste set out is not
excessive under that code section;
and
Whereas, residents of the City pay
a fee of $8.75 per month for trash pickup; and
Whereas, this Council believes that
the number of tickets given for
alleged violations of section 551.111 is
excessive and that the process is not
well controlled; and
Whereas, this Council believes that
the ticketing for setting out excessive
waste must stop immediately so that
the Department of Public Works and
the Commissioner of Waste Collection
can better control the process in order
to issue tickets appropriately and
accurately; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
property, health, safety, or welfare in
that a moratorium on the issuance of
tickets for infractions related to setting out excessively large quantities
of waste for collection in the City of
Cleveland is necessary to compel the
Department of Public Works to
review and improve the ticketing
process; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, for the reasons stated in the preamble, this Council
declares
a
moratorium
on
the
issuance of $100 tickets for infractions related to setting out excessively large quantities of waste for collection in the City of Cleveland until
authorization is reestablished by
Council. This moratorium does not

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL

Res. No. 733-16.
By Council Members Brancatelli
and Kelley.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Housing Finance Agency
(OHFA) to direct sufficient Hardest
Hit Funds to Cuyahoga County for
blight demolition.
Whereas, in February, the U.S.
Treasury awarded Ohio $97,590,720 in
additional Hardest Hit Fund money, a
substantial portion of which will be
devoted to blight demolition under
the next funding round of OHFA’s
Neighborhood Initiative Program
(NIP); and
Whereas, while many counties
have considerable needs, Cuyahoga
County has both the need and capacity to utilize these funds; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County has
robust acquisition capacity to meet
complex and time-consuming NIP
requirements that county land banks
take title to properties before the
demolitions can occur; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County has
consistently moved more than 1,500
vacant houses per year through expedited tax foreclosure, according to the
Plain Dealer, and the county prosecutor is now hiring ten additional
employees so that many more blighted houses will pass through expedited tax foreclosure over the next three
years; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County’s financial capacity has been enhanced by
county government’s decision last
year to commit $50 million of county
revenue to further blight removal;
and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County also
has demolition capacity, having
demolished 1,169 of the 2,168 houses
approved for funding reimbursement,
thus demonstrating 54% of statewide
demolition capacity to date; and
Whereas, the U.S. Treasury prioritized institutional capacity to spend
the funds for this funding round, stating in U.S. Treasury’s February 19th
press release, “. . . [U.S. Treasury] will
prioritize states that have demonstrated the ability to effectively
deploy funds”; and
Whereas, given that the U.S. Treasury’s key priority in making allocation decisions amongst the states was
capacity, OHFA should be guided by
the same in making its sub-allocations amongst the counties; and

June 8, 2016
Whereas, this Council appreciates
OHFA’s leadership on the critical
work of removing blight from Ohio’s
communities, and urges OHFA to
make capacity the key priority in
making allocation decisions for the
next round of NIP funding, and
accordingly direct sufficient funds to
Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio Housing Finance Agency
(OHFA) to direct sufficient Hardest
Hit Funds to Cuyahoga County for
blight demolition.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit a copy of this
resolution to Douglas A. Garver,
Executive Director, Ohio Housing
Finance Agency.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
