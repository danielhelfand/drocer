FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 1016-16.
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Brady and Kelley.
An emergency ordinance declaring
a moratorium on the review and
issuance of zoning permits, certificates of occupancy, and other license
or permit applications that would
enable cultivators, processors and
retail dispensaries of medical marijuana in the City of Cleveland.
Whereas, Substitute House Bill 523,
which legalizes the cultivation, processing and retail dispensing of medical marijuana in Ohio became effective on September 8, 2016; and
Whereas, among other things, this
bill permits patients in Ohio to use
medical marijuana on the recommendation of physicians; creates state
regulatory oversight of the cultivation, processing, retail sale, use and
physician recommendation of medical
marijuana; and prohibits a cultivator,
processor, retail dispensary or laboratory from locating or relocating within 500 feet of a school, church, public
library, public playground or public
park; and
Whereas, Substitute House Bill 523
further authorizes the legislative
authority of a municipality to adopt
regulations to prohibit or limit the
number of medical marijuana cultivators, processors or retail dispensaries
located within its borders; and
Whereas, this Council requires time
to review all applicable state and
local laws to make recommendations
on possible zoning prohibitions and
limitations of the cultivation, processing and retail sale of medical marijuana, to determine compatibility
with the city’s land use plans and

September 14, 2016
their effects on surrounding land
uses, and to maintain the public
health, safety and welfare; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
property, health, safety, or welfare in
that a moratorium on the review and
issuance of zoning permits, certificates of occupancy, and other license
or permit applications for medical
marijuana-related businesses including cultivators, processors, and retail
dispensaries is necessary to enable
this Council to consider all relevant
factors in order to make a determination as to what action is appropriate
for the City; now therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, for the reasons stated in the preamble to this ordinance,
this Council declares a moratorium on
the review and issuance of zoning
permits, certificates of occupancy,
and other license or permit applications that would enable cultivators,
processors and retail dispensaries of
medical marijuana in the City of
Cleveland, for a period of twelve
months commencing on the effective
date of this ordinance.
Section 2. That, as used in this ordinance, “cultivators”, “processors”, and
“retail dispensaries” shall have the
same meanings as in Substitute
House Bill 523 and Chapter 3796 of the
Revised Code.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately upon its passage and approval

FIRST READING
ORDINANCE REFERRED
Ord. No. 1015-16.
By Council Member Kelley (by
initiative petition).
An ordinance to supplement the
Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland, 1976, by enacting a new
chapter relating to “Democracy Day”
and providing that the people of the
City
of
Cleveland
support
the
to
amend
the
U.S.
movement
Constitution
to
establish
that
corporations are not people and money
is not speech and also providing for
biennial public hearings on these
topics.
Whereas, free and fair elections are
essential to American democracy and
effective self-governance; and
Whereas, in a 2010 decision by the
U.S. Supreme Court, Citizens United v.
the Federal Election Commission, the
Supreme Court overturned some
provisions of the federal Campaign
Reform Act enacted in 2002, and ruled
that corporate entities, and labor
unions, have the same rights as
individuals to unrestricted spending
on political speech; and
Whereas, in reaching its decision, a
majority of the Supreme Court
interpreted the First Amendment of
the Constitution to afford corporations
the same free speech protection as
natural persons; and
Whereas, the Court’s decision in
effect allows unlimited corporate
spending to influence campaigns,
elections, lawmaking, and public
policy decisions; and
Whereas, the Court’s decision in
Citizens United severely restricts the
ability of federal, state, and local
governments to enact reasonable
campaign
finance
reforms
and
regulations
regarding
corporate
political activity; and
Whereas, the people of the United
States have previously used the
constitutional amendment process to
correct decisions of the U.S. Supreme
Court that are widely deemed to be
egregious or wrongly decided or
significantly out-of-step with the
prevailing values of the populace; and
Whereas, the preservation and
protection of our democracy depend

upon the informed participation of the
citizens; and
Whereas, local governments have
an important role in protecting the
integrity of our political processes;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the People of the
City of Cleveland:
1.
That
the
Codified
Section
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976
are hereby supplemented by enacting
a new chapter to read as follows:
Democracy Day
Section 1. Beginning in the year
2017, the Mayor and City Council shall
designate one day in the second week
of May following the November
federal elections as “Democracy Day:
A Call for a U.S. Constitutional
Amendment.” On this day, the Mayor
and City Council shall sponsor a
Public Hearing in a public space
within the City. The City shall
publicize the Public Hearing on its
website and through area media at
least one (1) month in advance of the
Hearing. The Public Hearing will
examine the impact on the City of
political contributions of corporations,
unions, Political Action Committees,
and Super-PACS. The Mayor and at
least one (1) City Councilperson shall
submit testimony at the public
hearing. In addition, all citizens of
Cleveland will be permitted to submit
oral testimony for a period of at least
five (5) minutes per citizen. The
public hearing shall be held during an
evening or weekend time. The City
shall record the minutes of the hearing
and make them available to the public
no later than three months after the
Hearing by posting them on the City’s
website.
Section 2. Within one (1) week
following the Public Hearing, the
Mayor shall send a letter to the leaders
of the Ohio House and Senate, and
Cleveland’s
U.S.
Congressional
Representatives, and both Ohio U.S.
Senators stating that the citizens of
Cleveland in November 2016 voted in
support of a Citizen’s Initiative
calling for an amendment to the U.S.
Constitution declaring:
A)
Only
human
beings,
not
corporations, are legal persons with
Constitutional rights;
B) Money is not equivalent to
speech, and, therefore, regulating

1348

political contributions and spending is
not equivalent to limiting political
speech.
Section 3. The biennial Public
Hearings will continue for a period of
ten (10) years through May 2027 or
until a constitutional amendment
reflecting the principles set forth in
Section 2 is ratified by three-quarters
(3/4) of state legislatures.
Section 4. This initiative shall take
effect and be included in the City
Ordinances at the earliest date
permitted under Chapter V, Section 36
of the City of Cleveland Codified
Ordinances.
Section 2. That this ordinance shall
take effect and be in force from and
after the earliest period allowed by
law.

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 1079-16.
By Council Member Zone.
An emergency resolution opposing
the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline
and expressing solidarity with the
Indigenous
Resistance
to
that
proposed pipeline.
Whereas, the proposed Dakota
Access Pipeline would carry as many
as 570,000 barrels of fracked crude oil
per day for more than 1,100 miles from
the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota
to Illinois, passing over sensitive
landscape including treaty protected
land containing recognized cultural
resources and across or under 209
rivers,
creeks
and
tributaries
including the pristine Missouri River,
which provides drinking water and
irrigates
agricultural
land
in
communities across the Midwest; and
Whereas, despite deep opposition
from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe,
as well as farmers, scientists, more
than 30 environmental advocacy
groups
and
566
Tribal
nations
worldwide,
without
Tribal
consultation
or
meaningful
environmental review as required by
federal law, in July, 2016 the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers issued a permit
allowing construction of the fracked
oil pipeline to move forward; and

September 14, 2016
Whereas, in a show of cooperation
not seen in the 140 years since the
Battle of Greasy Grass or Custer’s
Last Stand, members of the Lakota
Standing Rock Sioux Tribe have
united with the Oceti Sakowin, the
Seven Fires Council – which include
the confederation of Lakota, Dakota
and Nakota Nations – and established
a peaceful encampment in Cannon
Ball, North Dakota known as Sacred
Stones Camp to resist the construction
of the Dakota Access Pipeline with a
cultural and spiritual presence; and
Whereas, on August 15, 2016 the
Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Council
by
Tribal
Chairman
David
led
Archambault II called on Tribal
Nations and Indigenous people around
the world to issue resolutions in
support of the Standing Rock Sioux
and the Sacred Stone Camp which has
been answered with the supporting
Tribes numbering 566; and
this
Council
also
Whereas,
recognizes the City’s own Indigenous
roots beginning with the Mound
Builders all the way to the Iroquois,
Seneca, Chippewa and Algonquians,
and many others; with these cultures
as our roots, we are bound to protect
water, just as the shores of Lake Erie
are center to life here in Cleveland, so
too the Standing Rock Sioux recognize
and understand that without water,
there is no life; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes
an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes
the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline
and expresses solidarity with the
Indigenous
Resistance
to
that
proposed pipeline.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to President Obama, all
members
of
the
United
States
Congress
and
Standing
Rock
Reservation.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

That
this
Council
Section
authorizes the submission to the
electors of the City of Cleveland at a
special election to be held at the usual
places of voting in the City of
Cleveland on May 2, 2017, of an
initiated proposal to amend the
Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland, 1976, by enacting new
sections 174.01, 174.02, 174.03, 174.04,
174.05, and 174.06 to read, respectively,
as follows:
TITLE
CLEVELAND MINIMUM WAGE
Section 174.01 Definitions
For purposes of this Chapter:
(a) “An individual employed in or
about the property of an employer or
individual’s residence”, “casual basis”,
and “family member” have the same
meaning as those terms are defined in
Ohio Rev. Code Section 4111.14(D).
(b) “City” means the City of
Cleveland,
including
all
City
divisions, departments, and offices.
(c) “Covered employer” means any
person or entity employing 25 or more
employees in the United States during
the previous calendar year and who
otherwise meets the definition of
“employer” under Section 34a of
Article II of the Ohio Constitution.
(d) “Employee” has the same
meaning as in Ohio Rev. Code Section
4111.14 (B)(1), but does not include:
any individual employed by a solely
family owned and operated business,
who is a family member of one of the
owners; or any individual employed on
a casual basis in or about the property
of the employer or at the individual’s
residence.
Section 174.02 Required Minimum
Wage Rate
(a) Beginning January 1 following
the approval of this ordinance by the
voters, every covered employer shall
pay each of its employees working
within the geographical boundaries of
the City of Cleveland at a wage rate of
not less than $12.00 per hour; which
shall increase annually at a rate of
$1.00 per hour each subsequent
January 1, until the wage rate reaches
$15.00. Thereafter, the minimum wage
rate provided in this Chapter shall be
increased annually by the rate of
inflation for the twelve month period
prior to the September preceding the
required increase according to the
consumer price index or its successor
index for all urban wage earners and
clerical workers for all items as
calculated by the federal government
rounded to the nearest five cents.
(b) A covered employer is not
required to pay the minimum wage
rate established in this Chapter with
respect to an individual employee if:
(1) The employer has received a
license issued by the State of Ohio
authorizing payment of a wage rate
below that required by Section 34a of
Article II of the Ohio Constitution to
employ the individual employee with
mental or physical disabilities that
may otherwise adversely affect their
opportunity for employment; or
(2) The employer can demonstrate
that an individual employee receives
tips that combined with the wages
paid by the employer are equal to or
greater than the minimum wage rate

1349

17
for all hours worked. In such a case,
an employer may pay an employee
less than, but not less than half, the
minimum wage rate required by this
Chapter if the employee earns the
minimum wage rate established in
this Chapter for all hours worked
inclusive of tips.
Section 174.03 Prohibited Acts
(a) No covered employer shall pay
or agree to pay wages at a rate less
than the rate required by this Chapter.
Each week or portion thereof for
which the covered employer pays any
employee less than the rate required
by this Chapter constitutes a separate
offense.
(b) No covered employer shall
reduce the wage rate of any employee
as a consequence of this Chapter.
(c) No covered employer shall
discharge or in any other manner
discriminate against any employee
because the employee made any
complaint that the employee has not
been paid wages in accordance with
this Chapter, or because the employee
has or will cause any proceeding to be
instituted under or related to this
Chapter, or because the employee has
testified or is about to testify in any
proceeding related to this Chapter.
(d) No covered employer shall
otherwise violate any provision of this
Chapter. Each day of violation
constitutes a separate offense.
Section 174.04 Civil Actions
The City, an employee, or any
person acting on behalf of an
employee or all similarly-situated
employees may bring a civil action in
a court of competent jurisdiction for
such legal or equitable relief as may
be appropriate to remedy a violation of
Chapter 174, within three (3) years of
the violation or of when the violation
ceased if it was of a continuing nature.
There
shall
be
no
exhaustion
requirement, no procedural, pleading
or burden of proof requirements
beyond those that apply generally to
civil suits in order to maintain such
action and no liability for costs or
attorney’s fees on an employee except
upon a finding that such action was
frivolous in accordance with the same
standards that apply generally in civil
suits. Where a covered employer is
found to have violated any provision
of this Chapter, the covered employer
shall within thirty (30) days of the
finding pay the employee back wages,
damages, and the employee’s costs
and
reasonable
attorney’s
fees.
Damages shall be calculated as an
additional two times the amount of the
back wages and in the case of a
violation
of
an
anti-retaliation
provision an amount set by the court
sufficient to compensate the employee
and deter future violations, but not
less than one hundred fifty dollars for
each day that the violation continued.
Payment under this paragraph shall
not be stayed pending any appeal.
Section 174.05 Effect
(a)
Nothing
in
this
Chapter
interferes with, impedes, or in any
way diminishes the right of employees
to bargain collectively with their
employers through representatives of
their own choosing in order to
establish wages or other conditions of
work in excess of the applicable
minimum wage rate established in
this Chapter.
(b) Nothing in chapter shall be
deemed to nor shall be applied in such

18
a
manner
so
as
to
have
a
constitutionally prohibited effect as
an ex post facto law or impairment of
an existing contract within the
meaning of the Ohio or federal
constitutions.
Section 174.06 Severability
If any portion of Chapter 174 is held
invalid, the remainder of the Chapter
shall not be affected by such holding
and shall continue in full force and
effect.
Section
2.
That
the
forgoing
proposed amendment to the Codified
Ordinances, on receiving at least a
majority of the votes cast at the May 2,
2017 special election, shall become
effective immediately on its adoption.
Section 3. That the Clerk of this
Council is authorized to promptly
forward a certified copy of this
ordinance to the Board of Elections of
Cuyahoga County.
Section 4. That the Board of

given of the election to be held on May

the Codified Ordinances of this City
and otherwise to provide for the
election in the manner provided by the
general laws of the State of Ohio.

stated in the preamble hereto, which is
made a part hereof, this ordinance
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage by the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council.
