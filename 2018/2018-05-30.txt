An emergency resolution supporting House Bill 160, the Ohio Fairness Act which prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation
or gender identity or expression.
Whereas,
although
84%
of
Ohioans believe it is illegal, firing
someone because of their sexual orientation is actually legal in Ohio;
and
Whereas,
laws
discriminating
against the LGBT community can
and do drive away tourism, business, and top talent needed to fill
jobs; and
Whereas, North Carolina’s antiLGBT law cost it’s economy $100
million dollars due to the relocation
of the 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte to New Orleans; further, North
Carolina lost more than 2000 new
jobs
due
to
canceled
corporate
investments; and
Whereas,
businesses
want
to
invest in states that foster diversity, inclusion and a robust workforce
and therefore look to states with
LGBT non-discrimination protections
as a reason to invest; and
Whereas,
there
are
21
states
where consumers and employees are
protected from being denied jobs,
housing and services based upon
perceived sexual orientation or gender identity; and
Whereas, Ohio can avoid competitive risks and win investment, business, and talent by sending a clear
and consistent signal that the LGBT
community is fully welcome here;

Fairness Act, expands existing prohibitions against various unlawful
discriminatory practices to apply to
discriminatory practices based on
sexual orientation or gender identity or expression; and

immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

value debt service savings of at

structure or more favorable terms
under Credit Support Instruments.
With respect to Outstanding Revenue Bonds that are short-term or
variable-rate obligations, this Council authorizes the City to issue
Refunding Bonds to refund such
Outstanding Revenue Bonds, or designated portions thereof, on the further basis that the Director of

designation,
provided
that
the
Refunding Bonds of each Series satisfy the requirements of this Ordinance. Separate Series of Refunding
Bonds may be issued at the same or
different
times.
The
Refunding
Bonds of each Series shall be designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of Award and shall
include in the designation reference
to the calendar year in which the
applicable Series is issued. A separate Certificate of Award and a separate Supplemental Indenture shall
be delivered for each Series.
Section 3. Variable Rate Refunding Bonds.
In the event that a Series of
Refunding Bonds bear interest at
variable interest rates, then the
Director of Finance is authorized to
determine the method and procedure
by which the variable rate of interest to be borne by the Refunding
Bonds of that Series shall be determined, whether by reference to a

agent or otherwise; provided that no
variable rate Refunding Bonds may
bear interest at a rate in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) per year
(including any Refunding Bonds
held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument). The Director of
Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate Series of
Refunding Bonds may or may not
permit the holders to tender their
variable rate Refunding Bonds for
purchase by the City. The Director
of Finance shall also designate in
the Certificate of Award for those
variable rate Refunding Bonds (and
may designate others, from time to
time, in substitution therefor) the
tender agent or agents and the
remarketing agent or agents, which
designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of each Series of variable rate Refunding Bonds, and
from time to time thereafter so long
as the variable rate Refunding
Bonds of that Series are outstanding, with providers of Credit Support
Instruments, tender agents (which
may be the Trustee), remarketing
agents (which may be any of the
Original Purchasers), purchasers of
tendered Refunding Bonds, and others as may be determined by the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, to be necessary or appropriate
to provide for (i) the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, (ii) the rights and procedures
for tender, (iii) liquidity or credit
support, (iv) repayment by the City
of any amounts drawn under the
Credit Support Instrument, (v) the
direct purchase of tendered Refunding Bonds, and (vi) other arrange-

The City Record
ments in the best interests of the
City. The Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any
such agreements if the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the City’s best interests
will be served by such termination.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to enter into agreements,
from time to time so long as the
variable rate Refunding Bonds are
outstanding,

or
amending the applicable Supplemental Indenture for a series of
Refunding Bonds as provided in Section 9. The Director of Finance is
authorized to pay any fees associated with agreements entered into
or terminated pursuant to this Section from proceeds of Refunding
Bonds, to the extent permitted by
the Indenture, and from the Net Revenues of the Utility.
Section 4. Award and Sale of
Refunding Bonds.
The Director of Finance shall sign
and deliver a Certificate of Award
for the Refunding Bonds. In the
event the Refunding Bonds are
issued in more than one series sold
at different times, a separate Certificate of Award shall be signed
and delivered for each separately
delivered series. The sale of the
Refunding Bonds shall be awarded
to the Original Purchaser selected
by the Director of Finance and identified in the Certificate of Award. In
the case of Refunding Bonds to be
underwritten in a public offering,
the Director of Finance shall select
the Original Purchaser based on her
evaluation, in consultation with a
Financial Advisor, of the qualifications and relevant experience of
firms that have proposed to underwrite the Refunding Bonds. Alternatively, the Director of Finance
may determine, in consultation with
a Financial Advisor, that more
advantageous terms for the Refunding Bonds may be obtained by the
private placement of the Refunding
Bonds with an investor or investors
(including
financial
institutions)
purchasing for their own account
and not for resale, in which case the
Director of Finance may designate
such investor or investors as the
Original
Purchaser.
In
addition,
each Certificate of Award shall
determine the following, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, consistent with this Ordinance and the Indenture:
(a)
the
aggregate
principal
amount of Refunding Bonds issued;
(b) the purchase price to be paid
to the City by the Original Purchasers, which amount shall be not
less than: (i) 97% of the amount
determined by adding to the aggregate
principal
amount
of
the
Refunding Bonds any aggregate
original issue premium and subtracting from the amount any aggregate original issue discount, plus
(ii) any accrued interest on the
Refunding Bonds from their date to
the date of their delivery to the
Original Purchasers;
(c) whether any Refunding Bonds
are to be subject to redemption prior
to maturity, and, if so, the redemption date for those Refunding Bonds
subject to prior redemption and the
redemption price, which may be
determined as a percentage of the
principal amount redeemed or by a

939

15
formula intended to make the bondholder whole for the loss of the
investment resulting from the early
redemption or by other methodology;
(d) the dates on which and
amounts in which principal of the
Refunding Bonds is to be paid,
which shall be not later than thirty
(30) years from their respective
dates of issuance, with an identification of whether the payment is
due by stated maturity or by mandatory sinking fund redemption of
Refunding Bonds of a particular
maturity;
(e) the interest rates to be borne
by Refunding Bonds bearing interest at a fixed rate, the weighted
average of which shall not exceed
eight percent (8%) as to Refunding
Bonds of any Series that are TaxExempt Obligations or ten percent
(10%) as to Refunding Bonds of any
Series that are Taxable Obligations,
or the method by which the interest
rate is to be determined for Refunding Bonds bearing interest at variable rates, consistent with Section 3;
(f) the particular Outstanding
Revenue Bonds or portions thereof
to be Refunded Bonds, and the date
or dates on which the Refunded
Bonds shall be called for redemption
or otherwise retired;
(g) the title and Series designation for the Refunding Bonds;
(h) the amount, if any, and source
of any money to be deposited in the
Debt Service Reserve Fund in order
to cause the balance therein to
equal the Debt Service Reserve
Requirement, if and to the extent
required by the applicable Supplemental Indenture, and any determination as to whether there shall be
a special reserve fund for the
Refunding Bonds of any Series, separate from the Debt Service Reserve
Fund, and any determination as to
whether a Credit Support Instrument shall be provided in lieu of
cash in the Debt Service Reserve
Fund or such special reserve fund;
(i) the Paying Agent; and
(j) whether any Refunding Bonds
are to be secured by or payable from
any Credit Support Instruments.
It is determined that the terms of
the Refunding Bonds as so determined within the limitations set
forth in this Ordinance and as so
specified and set forth in the Certificate of Award will be in the best
interest of the City and consistent
with all legal requirements.
The Director of Finance may
enter into a Bond Purchase Agreement with the Original Purchasers
of each Series of Refunding Bonds
setting forth the conditions for
delivery of the Refunding Bonds
that are consistent with this Ordinance, the Certificate of Award, and
the Indenture and that are determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, to be customary
for water revenue bonds issued by
governmental
entities,
including,
without limitation, representations
as to the accuracy and completeness
of information contained in the Official Statement of the City described
in Section 14.
Section 5. Application of Proceeds
of Refunding Bonds.

the

of

Finance determines it is in the best

the
Refunding
Bonds,

Mayor,
Director
of
Finance and Director of Public Utilities, or any two of them, are authorized to sign and deliver to the
Trustee, in trust for the Original
Purchasers and subsequent holders
of each Series of the Refunding
Bonds, a Supplemental Indenture,
approved as to form by the Director
of Law, not inconsistent with this
Ordinance, the Certificate of Award
and the Indenture and not substantially adverse to the City as may be
approved by the officers signing the
same on behalf of the City. The
determination by those officers that
a Supplemental Indenture is not substantially adverse to the City shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing and delivery of that Supplemental Indenture by those officers. Subject to the Original Indenture as theretofore amended, any
Supplemental Indenture may contain
amendments to the Original Indenture, as theretofore amended, or
amend and restate the Original
Indenture, to permit the City to
obtain a Credit Support Instrument
or to permit increased flexibility for
the use of financial or credit structures and techniques determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be in the best interests
of the City.
In order to cause the proceeds of
each Series of Refunding Bonds and
any funds of the City deposited in
an Escrow Fund or in the Debt Service Fund to be invested as permitted under Section 9.02 of the Indenture so that the Refunded Bonds are
deemed paid and discharged, and in
order to cause the amount to be
deposited
to
be
dedicated
and
applied to the payment of the principal of and interest and any
redemption premium on the Refunded Bonds as and when due, to and
including the applicable redemption
date, the Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver one
or
more
Escrow
Agreements
between the City and the Trustee as
Escrow Agent, approved as to form
by the Director of Law, providing
for
the
establishment
of
each
Escrow Fund as a trust fund in the
custody of the Trustee and for the
investment, dedication and application of the moneys deposited in the
accounts therein and further providing for the payment of the fees and
expenses of the Trustee for the performance of its duties as Escrow
Agent.
Each
Escrow
Agreement
shall provide for the redemption of
the Refunded Bonds identified in
the applicable Certificate of Award
to be called for redemption prior to
maturity and shall provide irrevocable instruction to the Trustee to
effect such redemption in accordance
with
the
Indenture.
The
Director of Finance is authorized to
take such other actions as may be
necessary or appropriate to accomplish the refunding of Refunded
Bonds, including without limitation,
the retention of an independent public accounting firm to verify that
the securities to be in an Escrow
Fund are of such maturities or
redemption dates and interest payment dates, and bear such interest,
as will be sufficient, together with
any cash in an Escrow Fund, for the

May 30, 2018
payment of debt service on the
Refunded Bond to which the Escrow
Fund relates and to make any determinations required for the interest
on the Refunding Bonds to be
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
Section 8. Rebate Fund.
There is established and ordered
to be maintained a separate account
for each Series of Refunding Bonds
that are Tax-Exempt Obligations
within the Rebate Fund held in the
custody of the Trustee under the
Indenture. The Rebate Fund is not
pledged to the payment of debt service and is free and clear of any
pledge or lien given under the
Indenture
as
security
for
the
Refunding Bonds or the Outstanding
Revenue
Bonds.
Calculations
of
excess earnings that may be due
and payable to the federal government pursuant to the Code and
deposits to those accounts of the
Rebate Fund shall be made as provided in the applicable Supplemental Indenture.
Section 9. Remarketing.
In the event that the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is advantageous to the
City to convert the interest on any
short-term or variable rate Outstanding Revenue Bonds or Refunding Bonds to fixed interest rates for
a period of time or to maturity, or
to convert the interest on any shortterm or variable rate Outstanding
Revenue Bonds or Refunding Bonds
to a different variable rate period or
mode, or to terminate or take other
actions with respect to any existing
Credit Support Instrument that will
require a tender and remarketing of
any Outstanding Revenue Bonds or
Refunding Bonds under the Indenture (any such conversion or other
action or tender or remarketing
being collectively referred to in this
Section as “remarketing”), the City
shall undertake the remarketing in
accordance with the Indenture. In
connection with any remarketing of
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to take such actions that
she determines, based on the written advice of a Financial Advisor,
will facilitate the remarketing of
the Bonds or otherwise be in the
best interests of the City, including
without limitation, obtaining one or
more Credit Support Instruments,
terminating
any
Credit
Support
Instrument, and entering into agreements with one or more purchasers
for their direct purchase of the
remarketed Bonds in lieu of a public offering of the Bonds by a remarketing agent. In the event the Director of Finance determines, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the Supplemental
Indenture applicable to a Series of
Bonds to be remarketed in order to
address current market conditions
or to permit the use of or to terminate a Credit Support Instrument or
otherwise obtain financing arrangements advantageous to the City, the
Mayor, the Director of Finance and
the Director of Public Utilities, or
any two of them, are authorized to
sign and deliver an amendment of
that Supplemental Indenture, or an
amended and restated Supplemental
Indenture, approved as to form by
the Director of Law, subject to the
Original Indenture as theretofore
amended.

The City Record
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to satisfy any Debt Service Reserve Requirement or any
special reserve fund requirement for
the Series of Bonds to be remarketed, by the deposit of a Credit Support Instrument in lieu of cash, as
permitted and more specifically provided in the Indenture, and to apply
cash released from the Debt Service
Reserve
Fund
or
such
special
reserve fund to the payment of costs
of remarketing or other purposes
permitted by applicable laws. To the
extent the costs of remarketing are
not paid from any cash released
from the Debt Service Reserve Fund
or such special reserve fund, those
costs shall be paid from funds of the
Water Division, which are appropriated for that purpose.
The Director of Finance and the
Director
of
Public
Utilities
are
authorized to prepare one or more
disclosure documents in connection
with any remarketing of Bonds
under the same terms and conditions
as set forth in Section 14 of this
Ordinance
with
respect
to
the
issuance of Refunding Bonds. The
Director of Finance, the Director of
Public Utilities or any other officer
of the City, as appropriate under the
Charter, is authorized to take such
actions or cause to be taken such
actions as are necessary to maintain
the applicable tax status of such
Bonds, and the covenants and authorizations in Section 12 of this Ordinance shall apply to such Bonds.
The Mayor, the Director of Finance,
the Director of Public Utilities and
other City officials, as appropriate
under the Charter, are authorized to
sign and deliver such instruments,
certificates and documents as are
necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions authorized by
this
Section.
The
Director
of
Finance, the Director of Public Utilities, the Director of Law and other
City officials, as appropriate under
the Charter, are authorized to make
the
necessary
arrangements
on
behalf of the City to establish the
date, location, procedure and conditions for the remarketing of any
Bonds and to take all actions necessary to effect the remarketing of
any Bonds under the terms of this
Ordinance and the Indenture. The
Clerk of Council or other appropriate official of the City shall furnish
the Trustee a true transcript of proceedings certified by the Clerk or
other official, of all proceedings had
with reference to the remarketing of
any Bonds along with such information for the records as is necessary to determine the validity of the
remarketing.
Section 10. Tender Offers.
In connection with refinancing or
restructuring any Outstanding Revenue Bonds, the Director of Finance
is authorized to make a Tender
Offer for all or any portion of those
Outstanding Revenue Bonds or all
or any portion of any one or more
maturities
of
those
Outstanding
Revenue Bonds on such terms as the
Director of Finance determines, in
consultation with a Financial Advisor, will result in debt service savings to the City or the elimination
or modification of covenants that
are unduly restrictive or a more
favorable debt service structure or
more favorable terms under Credit
Support Instruments or other advantages to the City. The purchase

941

17
price for the purchase of any Outstanding Revenue Bonds tendered
for purchase in response to the Tender Offer shall be paid from proceeds of Refunding Bonds and any
other funds of the City available for
the
purpose.
The
Director
of
Finance is authorized to retain the
services of one or more firms to
serve as dealer manager, depository
and information agent in connection
with any Tender Offer and to pay
the fees and expenses of those firms
from proceeds of Refunding Bonds
or other funds of the City available
for the purpose; provided the Director of Finance determines that the
firms so retained possess the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required of them
and that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director
of Finance is authorized to prepare
disclosure documents relating to the
terms and conditions of the Tender
Offer and containing information
about the City and the Waterworks
System and to authorize the use and
distribution of those disclosure documents.
Section 11. Authorization of Hedging Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging
in
interest
rate
hedging
arrangements with respect to Bonds
the City may reduce its cost of borrowing by optimizing the relative
amounts of its fixed and variable
rate obligations or minimizing the
risk of variations in its debt service
costs or obtaining savings by confirming rates of interest on Bonds
in advance of their issuance. To permit the City to have the flexibility
to undertake with respect to Bonds
interest rate swap, swaption, rate
cap, rate collar and other hedging
transactions, from time to time, and
to
establish
the
procedures
for
approving those transactions, this
Council authorizes the signing and
delivery of one or more agreements,
including amendments or supplements to existing agreements (each,
a “Hedge Agreement”), and any
related agreements necessary for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by each Hedge
Agreement. The authorizations in
this Section are supplemental to and
not in derogation of any authority
provided by any other ordinance of
this Council concerning hedging
arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Bonds
issued or to be issued under the
Indenture, the Director of Finance
may authorize one or more interest
rate hedge transactions in accordance with the applicable Hedge
Agreement; provided that (a) the
counterparty shall be rated at the
time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower than “A” by at least
one rating agency or its obligations
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
guaranteed or insured by an entity
rated at the time of signing the
Hedge Agreement not lower than
“A” by at least one rating agency,
with such rating in either case
determined without regard to a gradation by numerical or plus or

18
minus or other modifier and (b) the
term of each hedge transaction shall
not exceed the final maturity of the
Bonds to which the hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the payments to be made
by the counterparty to the City, or
by the City to the counterparty,
shall be fair value for the Hedge
Agreement,
considering,
among
other things, the credit of the City
and the counterparty and the terms
and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. The Director of Finance shall
determine the terms and conditions
of the Hedge Agreement, including
without limitation, the rates to be
paid by the counterparty to the City
and by the City to the counterparty
under the Hedge Agreement, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
and whether the obligations of the
City under the Hedge Agreement
shall be secured by a Credit Support
Instrument. The approval of each
interest rate hedge transaction by
the Director of Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
and
delivery
of
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to terminate any Hedge Agreements in whole or in part or any
Credit Support Instrument securing
a Hedge Agreement if the Director
of Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the City’s best interests
will be served by such termination.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to enter into amendments, novations, assignments or
modifications of a Hedge Agreement
or any Credit Support Instrument
securing a Hedge Agreement determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the City’s
best interests will be served by such
amendment or modification.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Net Revenues of the Utility and may be payable also from
other funds permitted by law to be
used for the purpose, as identified
by the Director of Finance in the
Hedge Agreement. Those payments
may be secured by a pledge of Net
Revenues that may be subordinate
to the pledge of Net Revenues for
the Bonds, to the extent permitted
by the Indenture, all as determined
by the Director of Finance and set
forth in the Hedge Agreement. The
obligation of the City to make payments under any Hedge Agreement
does not and shall not represent or
constitute a general obligation, debt,
bonded indebtedness or a pledge of
the faith and credit of the City or
the State of Ohio. Nothing gives any
party to any Hedge Agreement the
right to have excises, ad valorem or
other taxes levied by the City or the
State of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 12. Covenants of the City.
The City, by issuance of each
Series
of
Refunding
Bonds,

The City Record
covenants and agrees with the Holders of that Series of Refunding
Bonds, that:
(a) The City will use the proceeds
of the Refunding Bonds for the purposes specified in Section 2.

together
with
information from the City’s records
as is necessary to determine the regularity and validity of the issuance
of the Refunding Bonds.
(c) The City will, at any and all
times, cause to be done all such further acts and things and cause to be
signed and delivered all further
instruments as may be necessary to
carry out the purpose of the Refunding Bonds and this Ordinance or as
may be required by Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio or the Charter of the City or the Indenture or
the applicable Supplemental Indenture and will comply with all
requirements of law applicable to
the Waterworks System and the
operation thereof.
(d) The City will observe and perform all its agreements and obligations provided for in the Refunding
Bonds, this Ordinance, the Indenture
and each Supplemental Indenture.

from an office, trust or station upon
the City within the meaning of Section 2731.01, Ohio Revised Code.
(e) The City will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds that are issued as TaxExempt Obligations in such manner
and to such extent as may be necessary so that (a) the Refunding
Bonds will not (i) constitute private
activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or
hedge bonds under Sections 141, 148
or 149 of the Code or (ii) be treated other than as bonds to which Section 103(a) of the Code applies, and
(b) the interest thereon will not be
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code.
(f) The City covenants that (a) it
will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it
for the interest on the Refunding
Bonds that are issued as TaxExempt Obligations to be and to
remain excluded from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, (b)
it will not take or authorize to be
taken
any
actions
that
would
adversely affect that exclusion, and
(c) it, or persons acting for it, will,
among other acts of compliance, (i)
apply the proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds to the governmental purpose
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield
on
investment
property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely rebate payments to the
federal government, (iv) maintain
books and records and make calculations and reports, and (v) refrain
from certain uses of proceeds, and,
as applicable, of property financed
with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the extent necessary to
assure such exclusion of that interest under the Code.

942

May 30, 2018
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Refunding
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues for which any portion of
the debt service is paid from proceeds of the Refunding Bonds (and,
if different, the original issue and
any refunding issues in a Series of
refundings), to the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on the Refunding
Bonds that are issued as TaxExempt
Obligations
from
gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the Director of Finance,
or any other officer having responsibility with respect to the Refunding Bonds, is authorized to take
such actions with respect to those
issues as they are authorized in this
section to take with respect to the
Refunding Bonds.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance or any other officer of the
City, as appropriate under the Charter, is authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Refunding Bonds as
the City is permitted or required to
make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation, any of the elections
available under Section 148 of the
Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting the favorable tax treatment or status of the
Refunding Bonds that are issued as
Tax-Exempt Obligations or interest
thereon
or
assisting
compliance
with requirements for that purpose,
reducing the burden or expense of
compliance,
reducing
the
rebate
amount or payments or penalties, or
making
payments
of
special
amounts in lieu of making computations to determine, or paying,
excess earnings as rebate, or obviating those amount or payments, as
determined by that officer, (b) to
take any and all other actions, make
or obtain calculations, make payments, and make or give reports,
covenants and certifications of and
on behalf of the City, as may be
appropriate to assure the exclusion
of interest from gross income and
the intended tax status of the
Refunding Bonds that are issued as
Tax-Exempt Obligations, and (c) to
give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for inclusion in
the transcript of proceedings for the
Refunding Bonds, setting forth the
reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances
relevant to the tax treatment or status of the Refunding Bonds and
interest thereon.
If the Director of Finance determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, and so specifies in the Certificate of Award
that the best interests of the City

best interests of the City, the Director of Finance is authorized to prepare and submit those applications
and to provide to each such agency
such information as may be required

if the Director of Finance determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, that the
City’s best interests will be served
by such termination. The cost of

other resolution or instrument by
which such pledge is created or any

deposit
legally
available
funds,

with the Trustee under the Indenture or an Escrow Agreement for
the payment of debt service requirements on any Outstanding Revenue
Bonds if, in the judgment of the
Director of Finance and the Director of Public Utilities, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, doing so will improve the debt
service coverage ratio of the Waterworks System (being the ratio of
Net Revenues to Annual Debt Service Requirements, as defined in the
Indenture). The Director of Finance
is authorized to make such deposits,
from time to time, from moneys in
the Additions and Improvements

Finance in consultation with the

Trustee of fees and expenses for its
performance of its duties under the

that the agreement satisfies the
requirements of this Section, and

the Escrow Agreement by those officers. The Mayor, the Director of
Finance and the Director of Public
Utilities, or any two of them, are
authorized, in the name and on
behalf of the City, to sign and deliver agreements, approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, with one or more institutions,
including agreements which will
enable the City to more efficiently
structure any escrow funds established pursuant to this Section, and
thereby maximize debt service savings and minimize negative arbitrage. The Director of Finance is
authorized
to
take
such
other
actions as may be necessary or
appropriate to accomplish any defeasance of the designated Outstanding
Revenue Bonds to be paid from any
escrow fund, including without limitation, the retention of a firm of
independent certified public accountants to verify that the securities to
be deposited in escrow are of such
maturities or redemption dates, and
interest payment dates, and bear
such interest, as will be sufficient,
together with any available moneys,
for the payment of debt service on
the designated Outstanding Revenue
Bonds.

By Council Member Kelley (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of one or
more series of subordinate lien
income tax refunding bonds to
refund currently outstanding general obligation and subordinate lien
income tax bonds of the city to
obtain
debt
service
savings
or
restructure the city’s outstanding
debt and authorizing and approving
related matters.
Whereas, the City has from time
to time issued general obligation
bonds in various series that are currently outstanding in the aggregate
principal amount of $211,400,000 and
issued subordinate lien income tax
bonds in various series and subseries that are currently outstanding
in
the
aggregate
principal
amount of $296,285,000; and
Whereas, this Council has determined to authorize the City to issue
from time to time one or more series
of Refunding Bonds (as defined in
Section 1) for the purpose of obtaining debt service savings or restructuring the City’s outstanding debt
with respect to any currently outstanding general obligation and subordinate lien income tax bonds of
the City; and
Whereas, the Refunding Bonds
shall be payable from and secured
by income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made
to the escrow agent for the City’s
general obligation bonds; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has previously certified to this Council that
the estimated life or usefulness of
each of the Projects (as defined
below) was, at the time the original
Bonds for each Project were issued,
at least five years, and that the
maximum maturity of that portion
of the Refunding Bonds to be allocated
to
each
of
the
Projects
financed by the original Bonds to be
refunded is December 31 of the
years determined by the Director of
Finance for each Project based on

May 30, 2018
each Project’s estimated life or usefulness; and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of Refunding Bonds is necessary to enable the City to take
advantage of favorable market conditions on a timely basis to obtain
debt service savings or to restructure its outstanding debt service
obligations and thereby to protect
and preserve the credit of the City,
and as a result, this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health and safety, and for the usual
daily
operation
of
a
municipal
department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Bonds may be issued in one or more

Bonds of each series shall be issued
in one lot as fully registered bonds
in denominations of $5,000 or any
integral
multiple
thereof.
The
Refunding Bonds may be delivered
only in book-entry form, and if so
delivered, shall be registered in the
name of the Depository (as defined
in the Indenture) or its nominee, as
registered owner, and immobilized
in the custody of the Depository,
and shall not be transferable or
exchangeable (except for transfer to
another Depository or its nominee)
without further action by the City
pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture
and
the
Supplemental
Indenture (as identified in Section
8). The Refunding Bonds shall bear
the designation and be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award. The Refunding
Bonds shall be issuable as either
bonds the interest on which is (i)
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes (the “TaxExempt Refunding Bonds”), or (ii)
included as gross income for federal income tax purposes (the “Taxable Refunding Bonds”). The Director of Finance shall determine the
status of any series of Refunding
Bonds as Tax-Exempt Refunding
Bonds or as Taxable Refunding
Bonds (the “Tax Status”), and shall
designate the applicable series of
Refunding Bonds as such in the Certificate of Award. The Refunding
Bonds shall be signed by the officials of the City and in the manner
set forth in the Indenture.
The Refunding Bonds shall be
dated the date and shall bear interest at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, provided the weighted average of such rates per series of
Refunding
Bonds
(taking
into
account the principal amount and
maturity of each Refunding Bond to
which a rate applies) shall not
exceed 8% per year as to Refunding
Bonds of any series that are TaxExempt Refunding Bonds or 10%
per year as to Refunding Bonds of
any series that are Taxable Refunding Bonds. Interest on the Refunding Bonds shall be payable when
due, or until the principal amount is
paid, semiannually as specified in
the Certificate of Award as the
dates on which interest on the
Refunding Bonds shall be payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”),
beginning on the date specified in
the Certificate of Award as the first
Interest Payment Date.
The
Refunding
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts as shall be permitted by
law and determined by the Director
of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based on (i) the
written advice of a Financial Advisor to be in the best interests of the
City given market conditions at the
time the Refunding Bonds are sold
and (ii) the objectives of the plan
of refunding to either obtain aggregate net present value debt service
savings of not less than 3% or
restructure outstanding debt of the
City.
The Director of Finance also shall
determine and certify, on or prior to

22
the date of delivery of the Refunding Bonds to the Original Purchaser, that portion of the aggregate
principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds that is allocable to each Project, and the principal amount of
Refunding Bonds allocated to each
Project that shall be payable at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (as defined below) on
the applicable principal payment
dates; provided, that (i) the aggregate
principal
amount
of
the
Refunding Bonds allocable to a Project shall be determined by the
Director of Finance on a pro rata
basis by reference to the respective
amount of funds that is required for
the
refunding
of
the
Refunded
Bonds that are allocable to that Project, taking into account any funds
other than the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds that are available
and appropriated for that purpose,
and (ii) no portion of the aggregate
principal
amount
of
Refunding
Bonds allocated to a Project shall be
payable later than the maximum
maturity for that portion of the
Refunding Bonds as certified by the
Director of Finance.
The Refunding Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued
as term bonds (the “Term Refunding Bonds”), payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements as defined and
further described below. The Director of Finance shall determine in
the Certificate of Award whether
any of the Refunding Bonds shall be
issued as Term Refunding Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Refunding
Bonds shall be payable pursuant to
mandatory
sinking
fund
installments rather than at stated maturity and the amount of principal to be
paid on each Mandatory Redemption
Date (the “Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be
subject to redemption prior to stated maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Refunding Bonds are issued as Term
Refunding Bonds, the Term Refunding Bonds shall be subject to
mandatory sinking fund redemption
and be redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements, at a redemption price
of 100% of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Refunding Bonds shall include amounts
sufficient to redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal
amount of Term Refunding Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Supplemental Indenture).
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Refunding Bonds may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity by and
at the option of the City, in whole
or in part on any date, in whole multiples of $5,000, on the optional
redemption dates and at the redemption prices specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,

The City Record
accrued interest to the redemption
date. Based on the written advice of
a financial advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the

Refunding Bonds. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to

City a bond purchase agreement
between the City and the Original
Purchaser
(the
“Bond

the Bond Purchase Agreement or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement
by
the
Director
of
Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Refunding Bonds, as

be purchased for the Escrow Fund,
the Escrow Agent is authorized to
file, on behalf of the City, subscriptions for the purchase and issuance

of and financially advantageous to
the City, the Director of Finance
may purchase and deliver those
obligations, engage the services of
a bidding agent or similar entity for
the purpose of facilitating the bidding, purchase and delivery of such
obligations for, and any related
structuring of, the Escrow Fund,
execute such instruments as are

the General Obligation Bonds of the
City issued and outstanding under
the General Bond Ordinance, to the
full extent required to meet debt
charges
payable
on
the
Bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the Indenture. The City
covenants to appropriate annually
sufficient amounts from the income
taxes to pay all debt charges on the
General Obligation Bonds, the Bonds
outstanding under the Indenture,
any Parity Obligations and the
Unrestricted Income Tax Obligations (each as defined in the Indenture). The City further covenants

income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not
be able to meet its obligations to the
holders of the Bonds.

City shall pay or cause to be paid

The City Record
Refunding Bonds, or there shall otherwise be paid to the holders of the
outstanding Refunding Bonds all
debt charges due or to become due
thereon, and provision shall also be
made for paying all other sums
payable hereunder, then and in that
event this Ordinance (except for
Section 7(b) hereof) shall cease to
be
of
further
effect,
and
the
covenants, agreements and other
obligations of the City under this
Ordinance shall be discharged and
satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee
shall at the request of the City execute and deliver to the City such
instruments in writing as shall discharge the lien hereof and enter on

(b) Payment and Discharge of

Bonds.
Outstanding
Refunding Bonds shall be deemed to
have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this Ordinance,

or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or

in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by an
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest,
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds to their date of
maturity or redemption, as the case
may be, or if default in such payment shall have occurred on such
date then to the date of the tender
of such payment; provided, that if
any Refunding Bonds are to be
redeemed prior to the maturity
thereof, notice of such redemption
shall have been duly given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the
Trustee shall have been duly made
for the giving of such notice. Any
moneys held by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the provisions of
this Section shall be invested by the
Escrow Agent in direct obligations
of the United States of America
maturing, or redeemable at the
option of the holder, at times and in
amounts sufficient to meet payment
of debt charges on the Refunding
Bonds, as directed by the Director
of Finance. Any income or interest
earned by, or increment to, the
investments held under this Section
shall, to the extent determined from
time to time by the Escrow Agent
to be in excess of the amount
required to be held by it for the purposes of this Section, be transferred
at the time of such determination as
provided in Section 17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance for unclaimed
funds held by a Paying Agent. In
the event of nonpresentment of any
Refunding Bond as described in Section 17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to

the Tax-Exempt Refunding Bonds in
such manner and to such extent as

costs of the Project. The principal
amount of each series of Bonds is
to be the amount set forth in the
Certificate of Award, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 5,
and determined by the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
the amount necessary, together with
other funds available for the purpose (i) to pay costs of the Project,
including funding interest on the
Bonds for a temporary period, (ii)
to fund any deposit to the Bond Service Reserve Fund required under

Section 3. Authorization of Hedging Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging
in
interest
rate
hedging
arrangements with respect to Revenue Bonds the City may reduce its
cost of borrowing by optimizing the
relative amounts of fixed and variable rate obligations, or minimizing
the risk of variations in its debt service costs, or obtaining savings by
confirming rates of interest on the
Revenue Bonds in advance of their
issuance. To permit the City to have
the flexibility to undertake interest
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions, from time to time, with
respect to Revenue Bonds and to
establish the procedures for approving those transactions, this Council
authorizes the signing and delivery
of one or more agreements (each, a
“Hedge Agreement”) and any related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section 3 are supplemental to and not
in derogation of any authority provided by any other ordinance of this
Council
concerning
hedging
arrangements.
Prior to entering into any Hedge
Agreement
with
respect
to
the
Bonds or any Credit Support Instrument with respect to such Hedge
Agreement, the Director of Finance
shall determine, based on the written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that (a) the Hedge Agreement or
Credit
Support
Instrument
with
respect to such Hedge Agreement is
(i) justified by the corresponding
benefit to the City, (ii) commercially reasonable based on then-current
market conditions, and (iii) in the
City’s best interests, and (b) the
City will receive fair value in return
for entering into the Hedge Agreement,
considering,
among
other
things, the credit of the City’s Airport System, the credit of the counterparty and the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. To
the extent that any amounts to be
paid by the City in connection with
any such Hedge Agreement or any
Credit
Support
Instrument
with
respect to such Hedge Agreement
are not paid from proceeds of the
Bonds, those amounts shall be paid
from Fund Nos. 60 SF 001, 60 SF 104,
60 SF 106 and 60 SF 141 and/or passenger facility charges, as determined by the Director of Finance
after consultation with the Director
of Port Control.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall determine the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement,
including without limitation, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
whether the obligations of the City
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
secured by a Credit Support Instrument, and the rates to be paid by
the counterparty to the City or by
the City to the counterparty under
the Hedge Agreement in the event
of the exercise of the option. The
approval of each interest rate hedge
transaction
by
the
Director
of
Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery
of the applicable Hedge Agreement
by the Director of Finance.

May 30, 2018
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into an amendment,
modification or novation of any
Hedge Agreement or any Credit Support Instrument securing a Hedge
Agreement or to terminate any
Hedge Agreement, in whole or in
part, if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
(a) the amendment, modification,
novation or termination is (i) justified by the corresponding benefit to
the City, (ii) commercially reasonable based on then-current market
conditions, and (iii) in the City’s
best interests, and (b) the City
received fair value in return for
entering into such amendment, modification, novation or termination,
given the credit of the counterparty
and the terms and conditions of the
amendment, modification, novation
or termination. To the extent that
any amounts to be paid by the City
in connection with any such amendment, modification, novation or termination are not paid from proceeds
of the Bonds, those amounts shall be
paid from Fund Nos. 60 SF 001, 60
SF 104, 60 SF 106 and 60 SF 141
and/or passenger facility charges,
as determined by the Director of
Finance after consultation with the
Director of Port Control.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from
the
Airport
Revenues
as
defined in the Trust Indenture and
may be payable also from other
funds permitted by law to be used
for the purpose, as identified by the
Director of Finance in the Hedge
Agreement. Those payments may be
secured by a pledge of Airport Revenues, to the extent permitted by
the Trust Indenture, all as determined by the Director of Finance
and set forth in the Hedge Agreement. The obligation of the City to
make payments under any Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not
represent or constitute a general
obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a pledge of the faith and
credit of the City or the State of
Ohio. Nothing gives any party to
any Hedge Agreement the right to
have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
In the event the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the Trust Indenture
or a Supplemental Indenture in connection with any Hedge Agreement
or any amendment, modification,
novation or termination of any
Hedge Agreement, then, subject to
the requirements of Article XIII of
the Trust Indenture, the Mayor and
the Director of Finance are authorized to sign and deliver a Supplemental Indenture or amendment of
an existing Supplemental Indenture.
Section 4. Terms of Bonds.
The Bonds shall contain the terms
provided in or determined pursuant
to, the Indenture, this Ordinance, the
applicable Certificate of Award and
the applicable Supplemental Indenture. Each series of Bonds may be
secured by a separate Supplemental
Indenture, or a single Supplemental
Indenture may secure more than one
series of Bonds.

The City Record
(a) General. The Bonds may be
issued as obligations bearing interest at fixed or variable rates. The
Bonds may also be issued as obligations under Federal or State programs that provide for interest payment subsidies or other financial or
credit support. In the event that the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best
interests will be served by a series
of Bonds bearing interest at variable interest rates, then provision
shall be made in the Supplemental
Indenture applicable to that series
for the method and procedure by
which the variable rate of interest
to be borne by the Bonds of that
series shall be determined (whether
by reference to a market index, by
a remarketing agent or otherwise);
provided that no series of variable
rate Bonds shall bear interest at a
rate in excess of twenty–five percent (25%) per year (including any
Bonds held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument). The Director
of Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate series of
Bonds may or may not permit the
holders to tender their variable rate
Bonds for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates
any series of Bonds as variable rate
Bonds, and if the Holders of that
series of Bonds are to be entitled to
tender those Bonds for purchase,
then the Director of Finance may
also designate for those variable
rate Bonds (and may designate others, from time to time, in substitution therefor), the tender agent or
agents (which may be the Trustee),
the remarketing agent or agents
(which may be any of the Original
Purchasers)
and
the
calculation
agent or agents (which may be any
of the Original Purchasers or the
Trustee), which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the parties so designated
possess the requisite resources and
experience to provide the services
required of them and that the terms
on which the designated parties
have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into agreements with
others in connection with the delivery of the Bonds, and from time to
time thereafter so long as the Bonds
are outstanding, as may be determined by the Director of Finance to
be necessary or appropriate to provide for (i) the method of determining the variable interest rates,
(ii) the rights and procedures for
tender, (iii) liquidity or credit support, (iv) repayment by the City of
any amounts drawn under the Credit Support Instrument, (v) the direct
purchase of tendered Bonds, and
(vi) other arrangements in the best
interests of the City. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to terminate any such agreements if the
Director
of
Finance
determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the City’s
best interests will be served by such
termination.
The
Director
of
Finance is further authorized to
enter into agreements, from time to
time so long as the variable rate
Bonds are outstanding, supplementing or amending the applicable Supplemental Indenture for a series of

951

27
Bonds as provided in Section 7. To
the extent that any fees and expenses
associated
with
agreements
entered into or terminated pursuant
to this Section are not paid from proceeds of the Bonds, those fees and
expenses shall be paid from Fund
Nos. 60 SF 001, 60 SF 104, 60 SF 106
and 60 SF 141 and/or passenger
facility charges, as determined by
the Director of Finance after consultation with the Director of Port
Control.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
any series of Bonds, and regardless
of whether that series of Bonds
bears interest at variable or fixed
rates, is authorized to contract for a
Credit Support Instrument, and to
pay the costs of it from proceeds of
the Bonds, if the Director determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, that the
Credit
Support
Instrument
will
result in a savings in the cost of the
financing to the City.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Bonds shall be issued in fully
registered form. The Bonds initially
may be delivered in book–entry only
form, registered in the name of the
Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the
custody of the Depository, and not
transferable
or
exchangeable
(except for transfer to another
Depository or its nominee) without
further action by the City pursuant
to the provisions of the Trust Indenture.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds of any series held in
a book–entry system, the Director of
Finance
and
the
Trustee
may
attempt to establish a securities
depository/book–entry
relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance and the
Trustee do not or are unable to do
so, the Director of Finance and the
Trustee, after making provision for
notification of the beneficial owners
by the then Depository and any
other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit withdrawal of the
Bonds of any series from the Depository, and authenticate and deliver
registered Bond certificates to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of action
or inaction of the City, of those persons requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into any agreements
determined by the Director to be
necessary in connection with the
book–entry system for the Bonds,
after determining that those agreements will not endanger the funds
or securities of the City under the
Indenture (as evidenced by the
Director’s signing of those agreements).
(c) Dates; Denominations. The
Bonds of each series shall be dated
as of the date or dates provided in
the Certificate of Award for that
series. The Bonds of each series
shall be issued in the denominations
permitted
in
the
Supplemental
Indenture for that series.
(d) Interest and Place of Payment. The Bonds of each series shall
bear interest at their respective
interest rates specified in the Certificate of Award (or, in the case of

28
variable rate Bonds, determined pursuant to the Supplemental Indenture) for that series. Bonds of the
same series and same maturity may
bear interest at different interest
rates. The Bonds of each series shall
bear interest from the most recent
date to which interest has been paid
or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided
for, from their date. The principal
and any redemption premium and
the interest payable on each series
of Bonds shall be payable at the
times, to the persons and in the
manner set forth in, or referenced
by,
the
Supplemental
Indenture,
including, without limitation, provisions
thereof
permitting
special
arrangements for payments to the
Depository.
(e) Maturities. The Bonds of each
series shall mature on the dates and
in the respective principal amounts
provided
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, consistent with this Ordinance and the Indenture.
(f) Prior Redemption. The Bonds
of each series may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity at the
option of the City, if and to the
extent so provided in the Certificate
of Award for that series. Any Bonds
so determined to be subject to
optional redemption and maturing
by their stated terms after the earliest optional redemption date shall
be subject to redemption at the
option of the City on or after the
earliest optional redemption date in
whole or in part on the dates and
at the redemption prices provided in
the Certificate of Award and in
accordance with the applicable Supplemental Indenture and the Indenture. The Bonds may be subject to

be subject to purchase by the City
in lieu of optional redemption if and
to the extent provided in the Certificate of Award and the applicable
Supplemental Indenture.
(h) Signing. The Bonds shall be
signed by the Mayor and the Director of Finance, and approved as to
form by the Director of Law. Any or
all of the signatures of those officials may be facsimiles. The Bonds
shall bear the corporate seal of the
City or a facsimile thereof.
(i) Numbering. The Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance.
Section 5. Award and Sale of
Bonds.
The Director of Finance shall sign
and deliver a Certificate of Award
for the Bonds. In the event the
Bonds are issued in more than one
series sold at different times, a separate Certificate of Award shall be
signed and delivered for each separately delivered series. The sale of
the Bonds shall be awarded to one
or more Original Purchasers selected by the Director of Finance, and
shall be identified in the Certificate

The City Record
of Award. The Bonds may be sold
by direct placement to one or more
institutions purchasing Bonds for
their own account and not for resale

redemption price or prices, which
may be determined as a percentage
of the principal amount redeemed or
by a formula intended to make the
bondholder whole for the loss of the
investment resulting from the early
redemption or by other methodology;

a special reserve fund for the Bonds
of any series, separate from the

Section 7. Authorization of Supplemental Indentures and Amendments of Indenture.
In order to secure the payment of
the principal of and any premium
and interest on the Bonds, the
Mayor, the Director of Finance and
the Director of Port Control, or any
two of them, are authorized, in the
name and on behalf of the City, to
sign and deliver to the Trustee, in
trust for the Original Purchasers
and
subsequent
holders
of
the
Bonds, one or more Supplemental
Indentures, approved as to form and
correctness by the Director of Law,
not inconsistent with this Ordinance,
the Certificate of Award and the
Indenture
and
not
substantially
adverse to the City as may be
approved by the officers signing the
same on behalf of the City. The
determination by those officers that
a Supplemental Indenture is not substantially adverse to the City shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing and delivery of that Supplemental Indenture by those officers. Subject to the requirements of
Article XIII of the Trust Indenture,
any Supplemental Indenture may
contain amendments to the Trust
Indenture
to
permit
the
City
increased flexibility for the use of
financial or credit structures and
techniques determined by the Director of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
in the best interests of the City.
Section 8. Credit Support Instruments. The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract from time to
time for one or more Credit Support
Instruments for any series of the
Bonds or any Hedge Agreement if
the Director determines, based on

Advisor, that the Credit Support
Instruments will result in savings to
the City, will stabilize interest rates
or minimize the risk of increased
interest expense or increased risks,
burdens, or other costs associated
with hedging arrangements or relating to the Bonds or reserve requirements. The Director of Finance is
further authorized to agree to the
amendment,
replacement,
assignment or termination of any Credit
Support Instrument if the Director
of Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the City’s best interests
will be served by such amendment,
replacement, assignment or termination. In the event the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the Trust Indenture
or a Supplemental Indenture in
order to permit the use of, or to
amend, replace, assign or terminate,
a Credit Support Instrument, the
Director of Finance and the Director of Port Control are authorized to
sign and deliver a Supplemental
Indenture
amending
the
Trust
Indenture or an amendment of a
Supplemental Indenture, approved
as to form and correctness by the
Director of Law. The cost of obtaining, amending, replacing, assigning
or terminating each Credit Support
Instrument, except to the extent
