Project Summary and Discussion
Two
parking
lots
on
Detroit
Avenue in Ohio City have been targeted for development of a $50 million project with approximately 161
apartments and over 20,000 SF of
retail space. Located between West
28th and West 29th Streets on
Detroit Avenue, Church & State will
have two buildings, one eleven stories high and the other seven stories, and include 211 indoor parking
spaces. The buildings will be separated by a public space, including a
splash fountain and seating for public events or concerts. The retail currently targeted includes a pharmacy, laundry, a hardware store or tool
lending library. The buildings, located on a RTA bus route will also
include 177 spaces for bike storage.
This form of dense residential development will support transit use,
walkability and bring more residents to the neighborhood.
The additional housing proposed
with this project will provide much
needed supply to an area that is in
high demand for people looking to
live downtown—where occupancy
has soared to nearly 98%. As young
professionals
and
empty
nesters
flock to downtown, they are sure to
be attracted to this project for the
possibility of living within walking
distance to many amenities downtown and Ohio City while maintaining the ease of access beyond downtown. The redevelopment is expected to be completed in second quarter of 2020.
Proposed City Assistance
The request to Cleveland City
Council is to authorize the Director
of Economic Development to enter
into a non-school Tax Increment
Finance (TIF) agreement with Project 29 Partners LLC or its designee,
for certain properties associated
with the project. This TIF agreement will be up to 30 years in
length. The City will declare certain
improvements with respect to the
project to be a public purpose and
exempt 100% of the improvements
from real property taxes. The project is subject to a15-year residential tax abatement. The TIF will be
on the commercial retail estate for
the first 15 years and will capture
the full value in the remaining 15
years.

The City Record
Under
the
agreement,
parcels
acquired and re-conveyed to the
developer will be subject to a TIF
under Section 5709.41 of the Ohio
Revised Code in consideration for
the developer agreeing to make certain improvements to those parcels
and making payments in lieu of
taxes (PILOTs) equal to the taxes
that would have been paid for those
parcels, but for the TIF. A portion
of the PILOT will be paid to the
Cleveland Municipal School District
in the amount the District would
have otherwise received, but for the
TIF. The balance of the PILOTs
will be utilized to fund eligible project costs and project debt.

notice requirement may not exceed
five (5) days for special event permits not subject to the requirements

issuance of special event permits,
which restrictions may consider the

Director’s rules and regulations, the
size of the property and the degree
to which the special event would
interfere with the historic use and
adopted recreational use policies for
the property.

The Director may charge a permit
application fee, subject to approval
of Board of Control, in an amount
not to exceed the Director’s cost in
administering such application.

issued to the applicant person or
entity, the special event permit holder shall do the following:
(1) maintain records of all vendors associated with the event,
including the name, address, phone
number, and description of all items
to be sold; and

REPRINT
Res. No. 24-18.
By Council Members Zone and
Kelley (by departmental request).
An emergency resolution approving the adoption of the Countywide
All Hazards Mitigation Plan for
Cuyahoga County, 2017 Update.
Whereas, hazard mitigation is any
sustainable action taken to reduce
or eliminate damage from future
disaster; and
Whereas, the Disaster Mitigation
Act of 2000 requires all communities
that desire to apply for federal mitigation programs to have an all-natural hazard mitigation plan; and
Whereas, the Disaster Mitigation
Act of 2000 also requires communities to review and revise the plan at
least every five (5) years to reflect
changes in development, progress in
local mitigation efforts, and changes
in priorities, in order to continue eligibility to apply for federal mitigation programs; and
Whereas, the all-natural hazard
mitigation plan must meet the criteria established by the Federal
Emergency
Management
Agency
(“FEMA”); and
Whereas, for disasters that are
declared after November 1, 2004 that
the local government must have an
approved mitigation plan; and
Whereas, in collaboration with
participating jurisdictions, the Cuyahoga County Government, through
the Cuyahoga County Office of
Emergency Management developed
and maintains such a mitigation

plan which is entitled the “Countywide All Hazards Mitigation Plan
for Cuyahoga County”; and
Whereas,
each
jurisdiction
requesting approval of the plan
must document that the plan has
been formally adopted; and
Whereas, adoption of the “Countywide All Hazards Mitigation Plan”
is a condition of eligibility to
receive federal mitigation funds
available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

1.

Council
approves the adoption of the Countywide All Hazards Mitigation Plan

declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the

eligible securities in the aggregate

amount of public monies to be at the
time so deposited. In the case of any
deposit other than the initial deposit
made during the period of designation, the amount of the aggregate
market value of securities required
to be pledged and deposited, shall
be equal to one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the amount of public monies on deposit in such public
depository plus one hundred and ten
percent (110%) of the amount to be
so deposited. The City Treasurer
may require additional eligible securities to be deposited to provide for
any depreciation which may occur
in the market value of any of the
securities so deposited. This paragraph shall not apply to a pooled
security
arrangement
authorized
under division (c) of this section.
(b) The following securities shall
be eligible securities for the purposes of this section:

subdivision is pledged;
(5) Obligations guaranteed as to
principal and interest by the Ohio
student loan commission;
(6) A no-load money market mutual fund that is registered as an

(c) The City shall not accept as
eligible securities for purposes of
this section any securities which are
part of a pool of securities authorized in RC 135.182, unless authorized in advance and in writing by
the Director of Finance and the City
Treasurer.
(d) If the eligible depository fails
to pay over any part of the deposit
made therein as provided by law,
the City Treasurer shall sell at public sale any of the eligible securities
deposited with the City Treasurer
pursuant to this section. Thirty (30)
days notice of such sale shall be
given in a newspaper of general circulation within the City of Cleveland. Pursuant to division (C) of RC
135.18, when a sale of eligible securities has been so made and upon
payment to the City Treasurer of
the purchase money, the City Treasurer shall transfer such eligible
securities, whereupon the absolute
ownership of such eligible securities
shall pass to the purchasers, and
any surplus remaining after deducting the amount due the City of

Cleveland and the expenses of sale
shall be paid to the eligible depository.
(e) An eligible depository may, by
written notice to the City Treasurer, designate a qualified trustee and
deposit
the
eligible
securities
required by this section with the
trustee for safekeeping for the
account of the City Treasurer and
the eligible depository, as their
respective rights to and interest in
such securities under this section
may appear and be asserted by written notice to or demand upon the
trustee pursuant to division (D) of
RC 135.18. In such case, the City
Treasurer shall accept the written
receipt of the trustee describing the
securities which have been deposited with the trustee by the eligible
depository, a copy of which shall
also be delivered to the eligible
depository. Thereupon all such securities so deposited with the trustee
are, pursuant to division (D) of RC
135.18 deemed to be pledged with
the City Treasurer and to be deposited with him or her, for all the purposes of this section. The qualified
trustee designated to perform the
duties pursuant to this division (e)
must be approved by the Director of
Finance prior to designation by the
eligible depository.
(f) The City Treasurer may make
provisions for the exchange and
release of securities and the substitution of other eligible securities
therefor.
(g) Pursuant to division (I) of RC
135.18, any federal reserve bank or
branch thereof located in the State
of Ohio, without compliance with RC
sections 1109.03, 1109.04, 1109.17 and

relative to the exercise by corporations of trust powers generally, is
qualified to act as trustee for the
safekeeping of securities under this
section.

February 7, 2018
(h) Notwithstanding the fact that
an eligible depository is required to
pledge eligible securities in certain
amounts to secure deposits of public monies, a trustee shall have no
duty or obligation to determine the
eligibility, market value, or face
value of any securities deposited
with the trustee by an eligible
depository. This applies in all situations including, without limitation,
a substitution or exchange of securities.
(i) Any charges or compensation
of a designated trustee for acting as
such under this section shall be paid
by the eligible depository and in no
event shall be chargeable to the
City or to the City Treasurer or to
any officer of the City. Pursuant to
RC 135.18, such charges or compensation shall not be a lien or charge
upon the securities deposited for
safekeeping prior or superior to the
rights to and interests in such securities of the City or of the City Treasurer. Pursuant to RC 135.18, the
City Treasurer and the City Treasurer’s bondsmen or surety shall be
relieved from any liability to the
City or to the eligible depository for
the loss or destruction of any securities deposited with a qualified
trustee pursuant to this section.
Section 2. That existing Section
178.10 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended
by Ordinance No. 2353-93, passed
February 14, 1994, is repealed.

declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
