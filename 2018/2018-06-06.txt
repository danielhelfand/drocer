the proposed use are comparable to
the
impacts
typically
associated
with uses permitted in the General
Industry
District
without
the
requirement for issuance of a Special Permit;
D. Hours of operation of the proposed use;
E. Hazards associated with combustible, flammable or explosive
materials on the property of the proposed use;
F.
The
potential
for
adverse

of landscaping, buffering, or topographical features.
(2) Applications for Special Permits. The applicant for a Special
Permit in the General Industry District shall submit to the Board of
Zoning
Appeals
an
application
demonstrating that the proposed use
will not adversely impact other
properties, specifically with respect
to the factors listed in this division.
In evaluating the application, the

City officials or others with appropriate technical expertise.

By Council Members Griffin, Kelley, Zone, B. Jones, McCormack,
Bishop, Cleveland, Conwell, Johnson, Hairston, J. Jones and Santana.
An emergency resolution establishing a working committee of
Council, the Jackson Administration,
and
community
stakeholders
to
study policies regarding fair application of marijuana charges, further
decriminalization, and preparedness
for legalization of recreational marijuana; urging the Ohio General
Assembly to further decriminalize
marijuana possession by lowering
penalties;
and
supporting
a
statewide ballot measure to legalize
recreational marijuana.
Whereas, Ohio cities of Toledo,
Athens, Bellaire, Logan, Newark,
and Roseville have passed ballot
measures by initiative petition campaigns and enacted ordinances that
lowered the penalties for misdemeanor marijuana offenses, including possession of marijuana of 200
grams or less, to no fines or prison
time; and
Whereas, after findings of uneven
enforcement of marijuana charges
against minorities, New York City
responded by halting arrests for
smoking marijuana in public and
convening
a
working
group
to
examining police department policies; Atlanta responded by enacting

The City Record
an ordinance that lowers the penalty for small amounts of marijuana
possession to a nominal fine with no
prison time; and
Whereas, this Council and the
Administration
will
establish
a
working group, including the Health
Department, Public Safety Department, City Planning Commission,
other law enforcement agencies and
courts,
Council,
and
community
stakeholders to study current policies, determine if a disproportionate
number of charges are brought
against minorities and poor individuals, and consider implementing
policies promoting fairness and further
decriminalization
through
lower penalties; and
Whereas, this working committee
will consider administratively halting marijuana possession arrests
and charges while studying fairness
policies, as well as vacating misdemeanor marijuana-possession convictions in the future, as Seattle
Washington is doing after state
legalization; and
Whereas, the committee will also
study the City’s preparedness for
eventual state legalization of marijuana, including planning for public
safety, health, zoning, economic,
tax, and budgeting effects; and
Whereas, this Council urges the
Ohio General Assembly to further
decriminalize marijuana possession
by lowering penalties and eliminating prison time beyond minor misdemeanor convictions in order to
avoid
unnecessary
incarceration;
and
Whereas, as accomplished in nine
states,
this
Council
supports
a
statewide ballot measure to legalize
recreational marijuana, as an alternative to punitive criminal justice
policies that have led to more incarceration and a black market that
supports violent criminal enterprises; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council establishes a working committee of Council, the Jackson Administration, and
community stakeholders to study
policies regarding fair application
of
marijuana
charges,
further
decriminalization, and preparedness
for legalization of marijuana; urges
the Ohio General Assembly to further decriminalize marijuana possession by lowering penalties; and
supports a statewide ballot initiative to legalize marijuana.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to send copies of this
resolution to Mayor Frank G. Jackson and the Ohio General Assembly.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
