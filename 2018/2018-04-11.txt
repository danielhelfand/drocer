An emergency resolution supporting the millions of young people in
their “Enough is Enough” movement demanding that Congress and,
locally, the Ohio legislature pass
reasonable gun safety legislation.

The City Record
Whereas, on March 24, 2018, millions of America’s youth declared
“enough is enough” by participating
in a “March for Our Lives” that generated hundreds of marches across
the country and the world; and
Whereas,
these
young
people
marched to demand an end to gun
violence in the nation’s schools and
in the nation’s streets, and insist
that Congress pass legislation that
requires
universal
background
checks,
prohibits
civilians
from
acquiring
assault
weapons,
and
bans high-capacity magazines and
bump stocks; and
Whereas,
students
from
many
northeast Ohio schools marched here
in Cleveland as one of 800 marches
planned internationally, spearheaded by students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the site of the latest
mass shooting that took 17 innocent
lives; and
Whereas, the March for Our Lives
movement
here
in
Cleveland
brought an estimated 20,000 people
to Public Square in solidarity with
March
for
Our
Lives
marchers
around the country, protesting gun
violence in our society and calling
for reasonable gun safety laws; and
Whereas,
beginning
with
the
shooting at Columbine High School
in 1999, more than 187,000 students
attending at least 196 primary or
secondary schools have experienced
a shooting on campus during school
hours; and
Whereas, that number – 187,000 –
means that the number of children
who have witnessed gunfire in their
schools exceeds the population of
Eugene, Oregon, or Fort Lauderdale,
Florida; and
Whereas, since Columbine in 1999,
there have been an average of 10
school shootings per year; and
Whereas, in 2007, a troubled freshman brought guns and knives to
Cleveland’s SuccessTech Academy
shooting at teachers and students;

April 11, 2018
the shooter shot two teachers and
two students before killing himself;
thankfully, all the victims survived;
and
Whereas, children are affected by
gun
violence,
not
only
in
our
nation’s schools, but also in movie
theaters, night clubs and in city
streets; and
Whereas, this Council congratulates these young people for their
commitment and activism and supports them in their fight to take
back their schools and their lives,
and in their demand for reasonable
gun safety laws here in Ohio and in
these United States; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the millions of young
people in their “Enough is Enough”
movement demanding that Congress
and, locally, the Ohio legislature
pass reasonable gun safety legislation.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to the President of
the United States and all members
of the United States Congress, and
to Governor John Kasich and all
members of the Ohio legislature,
and to representatives of March for
Our Lives.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted April 2, 2018.
Effective April 3, 2018.
