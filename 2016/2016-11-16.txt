An emergency ordinance approving

Whereas, under Section 5709.85 of
the Revised Code, if a municipal corporation grants an exemption from
taxation, they shall create a Tax
Incentive Review Council (“TIRC”);
and
Whereas, one of the functions of the
TIRC is to annually review all agreements granting exemptions from

on various factors, including fluctuations in the business cycle unique to
the owner’s business; and
Whereas, in compliance with Section 5709.85 of the Revised Code, the
City of Cleveland has created a TIRC
and the TIRC has made written recommendations on exemptions to be
approved by the legislative authority;
and
Whereas, under Section 5709.85 of

authority receives written recommendations from a tax incentive review
council, that legislative authority has
sixty days after receiving the recommendations, to hold a meeting and

Referred to Directors of Economic

Ord. No. 1337-16.
By Council Members Brancatelli,

request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic Development to enter into an Enterprise
Zone Agreement with Global X Associate, LLC, or its designee, to provide
for tax abatement for certain real
property improvements at 2101 Superior Avenue in the Cleveland Area
Enterprise Zone.
Whereas, by letter dated October 24,
2016, the City provided the Cleveland

November 16, 2016
Metropolitan
School
District
(“CMSD”) with a notice of proposed
tax exemptions required by the
Revised Code; and
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 94895, passed June 19, 1995, this Council
designated an area, which is in the
City of Cleveland and described in
File No. 948-95-A, as the Cleveland
Area Enterprise Zone (the “Zone”)
under Chapter 5709 of the Revised
Code; and
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 156814, passed December 8, 2014, this
Council changed the maximum term
of tax abatements from ten to fifteen
years, as now allowed under Ohio
law; and
Whereas, in August, 1995, the Director of Development of the State of
Ohio determined that the Zone contains the characteristics described in
division (A) of Section 5709.61 of the
Revised Code and certified the area
as an “Urban Jobs and Enterprise
Zone” under Chapter 5709 of the
Revised Code; and
Whereas, Global X Associates ,LLC,
or its designee (the “Enterprise”) has
proposed to renovate the existing
K.K. Holmes Building located at 2101
Superior Avenue in the Cleveland
Area Enterprise Zone; and
Whereas, the Enterprise has certified to the City that it would be at a
competitive disadvantage operating
at this location if taxes on certain real
property improvements were not
abated; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, safety, property, and
welfare and that its enactment is a
necessary prerequisite to providing
immediate assistance to create and
preserve
job
opportunities
and
advance and promote commercial and
economic development in the City of
Cleveland, and the assistance is
immediately necessary or jobs will be
lost; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
approves the application of the Enterprise for enterprise zone incentives
on the basis that the Enterprise is
qualified by financial responsibility
and business experience to create and
preserve employment opportunities in
the Cleveland Area Enterprise Zone
and to improve the economic climate
of the City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Director of Economic Development is authorized to
enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement with the Enterprise to provide
for a 10-year, fifty percent (50%) tax
abatement for certain real property
improvements commencing the first
year for which the real property
improvements would first be taxable
were that property not exempted from
taxation; the abatement shall be subject to annual review of the Tax
Incentive Review Council.
Section 3. That the terms of the tax
abatement shall be in accordance
with the terms in the Summary contained in File No. 1337-16-A. These
terms shall not be amended, nor shall
the tax abatement be assignable or
transferable to any entity, without
the prior legislative authorization by
Cleveland City Council.
Section 4. That the Director of Economic Development is authorized to
charge and accept fees in an amount
not to exceed the maximum allowable
under Chapter 5709 of the Revised

The City Record
Code and the funds are appropriated
for the purposes listed in Chapter 5709
of the Revised Code. The fees shall be
