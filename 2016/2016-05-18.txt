By Council Member Kelley (by initiative petition).
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976 by enacting new
sections 174.01 through 174.06 relating
to Cleveland Minimum Wage.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976 are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new sections 174.01, 174.02, 174.03,
174.04, 174.05, and 174.06 to read,
respectively, as follows:

Section 174.01 Definitions
For purposes of this Chapter:
(a) “An individual employed in or
about the property of an employer or
individual’s
residence”,
“casual
basis”, and “family member” have the
same meaning as those terms are
defined in Ohio Rev. Code Section
4111.14(D).

4
(b) “City” means the City of Cleveland, including all City divisions,
departments, and offices.
(c) “Covered employer” means any
person or entity employing 25 or more
employees in the United States during
the previous calendar year and who
otherwise meets the definition of
“employer” under Section 34a of Article II of the Ohio Constitution.
(d) “Employee” has the same meaning as in Ohio Rev. Code Section
4111.14 (B)(1), but does not include:
any individual employed by a solely
family owned and operated business,
who is a family member of one of the
owners; or any individual employed
on a casual basis in or about the property of the employer or at the individual’s residence.
Section 174.02 Required Minimum
Wage Rate
(a) Beginning January 1, 2017,
every covered employer shall pay
each of its employees working within
the geographical boundaries of the
City of Cleveland at a wage rate of
not less than $15.00 per hour. Beginning January 1, 2018, the minimum
wage rate provided in this Chapter
shall be increased by the rate of inflation for the twelve month period prior
to the September preceding the
required increase according to the
consumer price index or its successor
index for all urban wage earners and
clerical workers for all items as calculated by the federal government
rounded to the nearest five cents.
(b) A covered employer is not
required to pay the minimum wage
rate established in this Chapter with
respect to an individual employee if:
(1) The employer has received a
license issued by the State of Ohio
authorizing payment of a wage rate
below that required by Section 34a of
Article II of the Ohio Constitution to
employ the individual employee with
mental or physical disabilities that
may otherwise adversely affect their
opportunity for employment; or
(2) The employer can demonstrate
that an individual employee receives
tips that combined with the wages
paid by the employer are equal to or
greater than the minimum wage rate
for all hours worked. In such a case,
an employer may pay an employee
less than, but not less than half, the
minimum wage rate required by this
Chapter if the employee earns the
minimum wage rate established in
this Chapter for all hours worked
inclusive of tips.
Section 174.03 Prohibited Acts
(a) No covered employer shall pay
or agree to pay wages at a rate less
than the rate required by this Chapter. Each week or portion thereof for
which the covered employer pays any
employee less than the rate required
by this Chapter constitutes a separate
offense.
(b) No covered employer shall
reduce the wage rate of any employee
as a consequence of this Chapter.
(c) No covered employer shall discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee
because the employee made any complaint that the employee has not been
paid wages in accordance with this
Chapter, or because the employee has
or will cause any proceeding to be
instituted under or related to this
Chapter, or because the employee has
testified or is about to testify in any
proceeding related to this Chapter.

The City Record
(d) No covered employer shall otherwise violate any provision of this
Chapter. Each day of violation constitutes a separate offense.
Section 174.04 Civil Actions
The City, an employee, or any person acting on behalf of an employee
or all similarly-situated employees
may bring a civil action in a court of
competent jurisdiction for such legal
or equitable relief as may be appropriate to remedy a violation of Chapter 174, within three (3) years of the
violation or of when the violation
ceased if it was of a continuing
nature. There shall be no exhaustion
requirement, no procedural, pleading
or burden of proof requirements
beyond those that apply generally to
civil suits in order to maintain such
action and no liability for costs or
attorney’s fees on an employee except
upon a finding that such action was
frivolous in accordance with the same
standards that apply generally in
civil suits. Where a covered employer
is found to have violated any provision of this Chapter, the covered
employer shall within thirty (30)
days of the finding pay the employee
back wages, damages, and the
employee’s costs and reasonable
attorney’s fees. Damages shall be calculated as an additional two times the
amount of the back wages and in the
case of a violation of an anti-retaliation provision an amount set by the
court sufficient to compensate the
employee and deter future violations,
but not less than one hundred fifty
dollars for each day that the violation
continued. Payment under this paragraph shall not be stayed pending
any appeal.
Section 174.05 Effect
(a) Nothing in this Chapter interferes with, impedes, or in any way
diminishes the right of employees to
bargain
collectively
with
their
employers through representatives of
their own choosing in order to establish wages or other conditions of
work in excess of the applicable minimum wage rate established in this
Chapter.
(b) Nothing in chapter shall be
deemed to nor shall be applied in such
a manner so as to have a constitutionally prohibited effect as an ex post
facto law or impairment of an existing contract within the meaning of
the Ohio or federal constitutions.
Section 174.06 Severability
If any portion of Chapter 174 is held
invalid, the remainder of the Chapter
shall not be affected by such holding
and shall continue in full force and
effect.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately upon its passage and approval
by the Mayor; otherwise it shall take
effect and be in force from and after
the earliest period allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Finance,
Law; Committees on Workforce and
Community Benefits, Finance.
Ord. No. 622-16.
By Council Members Kazy, Keane,

756

May 18, 2016
regarding the public improvement of
resurfacing

the City of Lakewood for the City’s
portion of the improvement.
Whereas, the City of Lakewood will
be making the public improvement of
Lakewood
Heights
resurfacing

Chesterland Avenue in the Cities of
Lakewood and Cleveland (“Lakewood Heights Boulevard Resurfacing
Project”); and
Whereas, the approximate centerline of Lakewood Heights Boulevard
between the termini constitutes a portion of the municipal boundary
between the City of Lakewood and
Cleveland; and
Whereas, in order to ensure a seamless border between Lakewood and
Cleveland, to provide the most economical and efficient solution, and to
eliminate potential hazards to pedestrian and vehicular traffic, the City of
Cleveland desires to partner with the
City of Lakewood to allow Lakewood
to include the Cleveland portion in the
Lakewood Resurfacing Project; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of Capital Projects is authorized to enter into
any agreement or agreements with
the City of Lakewood regarding the
Lakewood Resurfacing Project to,
among other things, allow Lakewood
to make the public improvement of
resurfacing the portion of Lakewood
Heights Boulevard which is located
in the City of Cleveland; and to allow
Lakewood to apply for and accept federal funds designated for this purpose.
Section 2. That this Council authorizes payment to the City of Lakewood of Cleveland’s share of the
Lakewood Resurfacing Project, for
the portion that is located in the City
of Cleveland, from Fund Nos. 20 FS
520, 20 SF 528, 20 SF 534, 20 SF 540, 20
SF 546, 20 SF 554, 20 SF 563, 20 SF 568,
20 SF 574, and from the fund or funds
to which are credited the proceeds
from the sale of bond funds authorized by Ordinance No. 366-16, passed
March 21, 2016, and any future bonds
if issued for this purpose.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Capital
Projects, City Planning Commission.
Finance, Law; Committees on Municipal Services and Properties, Finance.
Ord. No. 623-16.
By Council Members Polensek,
Brancatelli and Kelley (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic Development to enter into an Enterprise
Zone Agreement with LaSalle AMC
TCE, LLC, or its designee, to provide
for tax abatement for certain real
property improvements as an incentive to develop the LaSalle Arts &
Media Center at 819-829 East 185th
Street in the Cleveland Area Enterprise Zone.

May 18, 2016
Whereas, by letter dated April 15,
2016, the City provided the Cleveland
Metropolitan
School
District
(“CMSD”) with a notice of proposed
tax exemptions required by the
Revised Code; and
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 94895, passed June 19, 1995, this Council
designated an area, which is in the
City of Cleveland and described in
File No. 948-95-A, as the Cleveland
Area Enterprise Zone (the “Zone”)
under Chapter 5709 of the Revised
Code; and
Whereas, in August, 1995, the Director of Development of the State of
Ohio determined that the Zone contains the characteristics described in
division (A) of Section 5709.61 of the
Revised Code and certified the area
as an “Urban Jobs and Enterprise
Zone” under Chapter 5709 of the
Revised Code; and
Whereas, LaSalle AMC TCE, LLC,
or its designee (the “Enterprise”) has
proposed to develop the LaSalle Arts
& Media Center at 819-829 East 185th
Street in the Cleveland Area Enterprise Zone; and
Whereas, the Enterprise has certified to the City that it would be at a
competitive disadvantage operating
at this location if taxes on certain real
property improvements were not
abated; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, safety, property, and
welfare and that its enactment is a
necessary prerequisite to providing
immediate assistance to create and
preserve
job
opportunities
and
advance and promote commercial and
economic development in the City of
Cleveland, and the assistance is
immediately necessary or jobs will be
lost; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
approves the application of the Enterprise for enterprise zone incentives
on the basis that the Enterprise is
qualified by financial responsibility
and business experience to create and
preserve employment opportunities in
the Cleveland Area Enterprise Zone
and to improve the economic climate
of the City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Director of Economic Development is authorized to
enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement with the Enterprise to provide
for a ten-year, sixty percent (60%)
tax abatement for certain real property improvements commencing the
first year for which the real property
improvements would first be taxable
were that property not exempted from
taxation; the abatement shall be subject to annual review of the Tax
Incentive Review Council.
Section 3. That the terms of the tax
abatement shall be in accordance
with the terms in the Summary contained in File No. 623-16-A. These
terms shall not be amended, nor shall
the tax abatement be assignable or
transferable to any entity, without
the prior legislative authorization by
Cleveland City Council.
Section 4. That the Director of Economic Development is authorized to
charge and accept fees in an amount
not to exceed the maximum allowable
under Chapter 5709 of the Revised
Code and the funds are appropriated
for the purposes listed in Chapter 5709
of the Revised Code. The fees shall be
deposited to and expended from Fund
No. 17 SF 305.

The City Record
Section 5. That the contract and
other appropriate documents needed
to complete the transaction authorized by this legislation shall be prepared by the Director of Law.

An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Capital Projects to
enter into one or more contracts with
TranSystems Corporation of Ohio for
professional services necessary to
emergency
assessment,
provide
inspection, and testing of the Willow
Lift Bridge, including the sheave
trunnion bearings and other components and engineering and design of
the replacement of bearings; one or
more standard purchase or requirement contracts with The Timken Corporation for the manufacture of one
or more bridge bearings; and authorizing written standard or requirement contracts for labor and materials for the installation of any bearings.
Whereas, in December 2015, one of
the counterweight sheave trunnion
bearings (“Bearings”) of the Willow
Lift Bridge was found to be in a state
of progressive failure and an emergency restraint system was installed
to allow the bridge to resume safe
operations on a limited basis; and
Whereas, TranSystems Corporation
of Ohio, a consultant operating under
the Office of Capital Projects’ general
engineering service contract authority,
partially
disassembled
and
inspected the northwest Bearings,
and performed vibration and lubricant testing; and
Whereas, the test results and an
April 20, 2016 inspection determined
that the bridge may remain operational if limited to four lifts per day
until the northwest Bearings are
replaced or repaired but that additional inspection, assessment, and
testing of the bridge is needed immediately to determine if the remaining
Bearings are in a similar state of progressive failure and present a danger
to the public health, safety or welfare;
and
Whereas, The Timken Corporation
is the sole-source manufacturer of the
Bearings; and
Whereas, it is necessary to provide
emergency assessment, inspection,
and testing of the other Willow Lift
Bridge Bearings and other components to determine if other labor and
materials are necessary for the
bridge to resume safe and normal
operation; and
Whereas, the Director of Capital
Projects has determined, that based
upon TranSystems Corporation of
Ohio’s knowledge of the bridge’s construction,
experience,
immediate
availability, quality, and cost, to
ensure safe operation, the City should
engage it to perform the additional
professional services needed for
emergency assessment, inspection,
and testing of the Willow Lift Bridge;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,

Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of Capital Projects is authorized to enter into
a contract with TranSystems Corporation of Ohio (“Consultant”) for the
professional services necessary to
provide an emergency assessment,
inspection, and testing of the Willow
Lift Bridge, including its Bearings
and other components, to determine
what labor and materials, if any, are
necessary to restore the bridge to safe
and normal operating condition, and
to perform the engineering and
design necessary to facilitate the
replacement of the northwest Bearings, in accordance with its April 20,
2016 proposal.
Except for Stafford
Bandlow Engineering, Inc. and SKF
USA, Inc., the Consultant shall not
sublet or subcontract performance of
any work or services or provision of
any supplies or materials without the
previous written consent of the Board
of Control.
Section 2. That this Council determines that the necessary Bearings
are non-competitive and urgently
required and cannot be secured from
any source other than The Timken
ThereCorporation (“Contractor”).
fore, the Director of Capital Projects
is authorized to make one or more
written standard purchase or requirement contracts with the Contractor,
for the requirements for a period not
to exceed one year, with one option to
renew for an additional year, exercisable by the Director of Capital Projects, of the necessary items of the
manufacture of Willow Lift Bridge
Bearings, at a cost of $309,499.70 for
the northwest Bearings and housings
and a cost based upon a quote from
the Contractor for any additional
Bearings, to be purchased by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
on a unit basis, for the Office of Capital Projects. Because the Contractor
requires a minimum of 26 weeks to
manufacture the northwest or other
Bearings, to preclude or minimize a
potential interruption of public service, an immediate purchase is
required. Therefore, the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies is authorized to issue one or more delivery
orders, for manufacture of one or
more Bearings required for the safe
operation of the bridge, notwithstanding that a contract with the Contractor may not have been executed. The
Contractor shall not sublet or subcontract performance of any work or provision of any supplies or materials
without the previous written consent
of the Board of Control.
Section 3. That, if necessary to prevent an interruption of public service
or a danger to the public health, safety or welfare, the Director of Capital
Projects is authorized to make one or
more written standard purchase contracts or requirement contracts,
notwithstanding any provision of the

779

Charter and the Codified Ordinances
of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, for a period
not exceeding one year, with one
option to renew for an additional
year, exercisable by the director, for
the necessary items of the labor and
materials for the installation of the
northwest and any other Bearings or
other related items determined to be
needed to restore the bridge to safe
and normal operating condition, to be
purchased by the Commissioner of
Purchases and Supplies on a unit
basis for the Office of Capital Projects affording as much competition
as is practical under the circumstances. Bids, quotes, or proposals, as
appropriate, shall be taken in a manner that permits an award to be made
for all items as a single contract, or by
separate contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board of
Control determines. The contractor
shall not sublet or subcontract performance of any work or provision of
any supplies or materials without the
previous written consent of the Board
of Control in accordance with Section
181.37 of the codified ordinances
Section 4. That the costs of the
requirement contract or contracts
shall be paid from Fund Nos. 20 SF
520, 20 SF 528, 20 SF 534, 20 SF 540, 20
FS 546, 20 SF 554, 20 SF 563, 20 SF 568,
or may be charged against the proper
appropriation accounts, and the
Director of Finance shall certify the
amount of any purchase under the
contract, each of which purchases
shall be made on order of the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies by a
delivery order issued against the contract or contracts and certified by the
Director of Finance.
Section 5. That the cost of any contract or contracts shall be paid from
Fund Nos. 20 SF 520, 20 SF 528, 20 SF
534, 20 SF 540, 20 FS 546, 20 SF 554, 20
SF 563, 20 SF 568, and other funds
approved by the Director of Finance.
(RQS 0103, RL 2016-48)

Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
