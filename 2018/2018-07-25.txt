FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED

Ord. No. 889-18.
By
Council
Members
Conwell,
Griffin, Johnson, Brancatelli and
Kelley (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance giving
consent of the City of Cleveland to
the Director of Transportation of the
State of Ohio to construct pedestrian enhancements known as Uptown
Mobility; to apply for and accept
any gifts or grants from any public
or private entity; authorizing the
Director of Capital Projects to enter
into any relative agreements; to
employ one or more professional
consultants to design the improvement; and causing payment of the
City’s share to the State for the cost
of the improvement.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That it is declared to be
in the public interest that the consent of the City of Cleveland is
given to the Director of Transportation of the State of Ohio (“the
State”) to construct the following
improvement under plans, specifications, and estimates approved by the
State: for the construction of pedestrian
enhancements
known
as
Uptown
Mobility
along
Ford
Drive/Mayfield
Road
from
East
Boulevard to East 126th Street,
Euclid Avenue from Adelbert Road
to East 118th Street and East 115th
Street from Euclid Avenue to Wade
Park Avenue and along “CircleLink”
bus route, PID 108542 (the “Improvement”).
Section 2. That the City proposes
to cooperate with the State in the
cost of the Improvement by assuming and contributing the entire cost
and expense of the Improvement,
less the amount of federal funds
allocated by the Federal Highway
Administration,
United
States

1202

July 25, 2018
Department of Transportation. The
City agrees to assume one hundred
percent (100%) of the cost of preliminary engineering, right-of-way
and environmental documentation.
Also, the City agrees to assume and
contribute 100% of the cost of any
items included in the construction
contract at the request of the City,
which are determined by the State
not eligible or made necessary by
the Improvement. The share of the
cost of the City is estimated in the
amount of $68,667, but the estimated
amount is to be adjusted in order
that the City’s ultimate share of the
Improvement shall correspond with
the percentages of actual costs
when the actual costs are determined. Also, the City further agrees
that change orders and extra work
contracts required to fulfill the construction
contracts
shall
be
processed as needed. The State shall
not approve a change order or extra
work contract until it first gives
notice, in writing, to the City. The
City shall contribute its share of the
cost of these items in accordance
with other provisions herein.
Section 3. That the Director of
Capital Projects is authorized to
enter into one or more agreements
with the State necessary to complete
the planning and construction of the
Improvement,
which
agreements
shall contain terms and conditions
that the Director of Law determines
shall best protect the public interest.
Section 4. Utilities and Right-ofWay Statement. The City agrees to
acquire and/or make available to
ODOT, under current State and Federal regulations, all necessary rightof-way required for the Improvement. The City also understands
that right-of-way costs include eligible utility costs. The City agrees
to be responsible for all utility
accommodation,
relocation,
and
reimbursement and agrees that all
such accommodations, relocations,
and reimbursements shall comply
with the current provisions of 23
CFR 645 and the ODOT Utilities
Manual.
Section 5. Maintenance. Upon completion of the Improvement, and
unless otherwise agreed, the City
shall: (1) provide adequate maintenance for the Improvement under all
applicable state and federal laws,
including, but not limited to, 23 USC
116; (2) provide ample financial provisions, as necessary, for the maintenance of the Improvement; (3)
maintain the right-of-way, keeping
it free of obstructions; and (4) hold
said right-of-way inviolate for public highway purposes.
Section 6. That the Director of
Capital Projects is authorized to
enter into contracts with ODOT prequalified consultants for the preliminary engineering phase of the
Improvement and to enter into contracts with the Director of Transportation necessary to complete the
above described project. Upon the
request of ODOT, the Director of
Capital Projects is also authorized
to assign all rights, title, and interests of the City to ODOT arising
from any agreement with its consultant in order to allow ODOT to
direct additional or corrective work,
recover damages due to errors or
omissions, and to exercise all other
contractual
rights
and
remedies
afforded by law or equity.
Section 7. That the City agrees
that if Federal Funds are used to

July 25, 2018
pay the cost of any consultant contract, the City shall comply with 23
CFR 172 in the selection of its consultant and the administration of
the consultant contract. Further, the
City agrees to incorporate ODOT’s
“Specifications for Consulting Services” as a contract document in all
of its consultant contracts. The City
agrees to require, as a scope of services clause, that all plans prepared
by the consultant must conform to
ODOT’s current design standards
and that the consultant shall be
responsible for ongoing consultant
involvement during the construction
phase of the Improvement. The City
agrees to include a completion
schedule acceptable to ODOT and to
assist ODOT in rating the consultant’s performance through ODOT’s
Consultant Evaluation System.
Section
8.
That
this
Council
requests the State to proceed with
the Improvement.
Section 9. That the Director of
Capital Projects is authorized to
apply for and accept any gifts or
grants for this purpose from any
public or private entity, including
but not limited to NOACA; and that
the Director is authorized to file all
papers and execute all documents
necessary to receive the funds under
the grant; and that the funds are
appropriated
for
the
purposes
described in this ordinance.
Section 10. That, when appropriate, the Director of Capital Projects
is authorized to enter into one or
more contracts with the railroads,
Greater Cleveland Regional Transit
Authority,
the
Northeast
Ohio
Regional Sewer District and other
entities to obtain services or to
acquire property rights such as
easements and licenses, necessary to
construct
the
improvements
described in this ordinance.
Section 11. That the Director of
Capital Projects is authorized to
accept cash contributions from public or private entities, for infrastructure restoration costs associated with relocating, rehabilitating or

Project Summary and Discussion
Alto JHB Acquisition, LLC or
designee, (“Developer”) is proposing
a mixed use redevelopment located
at 1001-1101 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44115 (“Project Site”). In
order to assist with the project
financing,
the
Developer
has
requested the City impose a 5709.41,
30-Year, Non-School TIF. The TIF
will support debt service related to
the project and assist with the redevelopment
of
approximately
228
market rate apartments, over 18,700
square feet of commercial space,
and parking for residents. The project will create and/or cause to create 30 new full-time jobs at the Project Site with an approximate payroll of $807,000.
Alto JHB Acquisition, LLC is an
entity of Alto Partners. Alto Partners is a global real estate development company and has completed
five projects in the U.S. totaling $200
million. As the CEO of U.S. Operations of Alto Partners, Michael
Sabracos has extensive business and
real estate development experience.
He has managed the acquisition,
redevelopment,
management,
and
sales of over 20 million square feet
of real estate. Alto Partners’ newest
project is the John Hartness Brown
(JHB) Building, which they purchased in August of 2017.
The JHB Building was constructed between 1914 and 1920, and sat
vacant for over a decade. Alto JHB
Acquisition, LLC plans to redevelop
the vacant property into the “Euclid
Grand”, rebranding the property.
The additional housing with this
project will provide a much needed
supply to an area that is in high
demand for people to live downtownwhere occupancy is nearly 94.5 percent. The total project investment is
expected to exceed $78 million.

Section 343.23 Pedestrian Retail Overlay (PRO) District
(a) Purpose. The Pedestrian Retail Overlay (PRO) District is established to maintain the economic viability of
older neighborhood shopping districts by preserving the pedestrian-oriented character of those districts and to protect public safety by minimizing conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians in neighborhood shopping districts.
(b) Mapping. The PRO District is an overlay district which shall be mapped only in an area where at least
seventy-five percent (75%) of the underlying zoning is either Local Retail or General Retail. In every PRO District, any street frontage to be considered a “Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage,” as defined in this section, shall
be marked on the Zoning Map, with either one (1) or both sides of a street designated as such.
(c) Applicability. The PRO District regulations shall apply only in those portions of a PRO District in which
the underlying zoning is either Local Retail or General Retail. In the relevant portions of a PRO District, the
regulations of the underlying zoning district shall govern except where in conflict with the regulations of the
PRO District, in which case the regulations of the PRO District shall govern.
(d) Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall be defined as stated below:
(1) “Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage” means that side or sides of a public street frontage where pedestrianoriented retail shopping activity exists or is expected to exist and such street frontage is specifically designated on the Zoning Map.
(2) “Pedestrian Retail Space” means that portion of a building or property located at or closest to the level of
the public sidewalk and within forty (40) feet of a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage.
(3) “Open Sales Lot” means a property or portion of a property used for the sale of merchandise stored in outdoor, unenclosed locations.
(4) “Institutional Use” means, for purposes of this section, a school, day care center, place of worship, place of
assembly, hospital, nursing home, residential treatment facility, or similar use.
(5) “Non-Retail Office” means an office use whose primary activity does not involve service to customers or
clients on the premises.
(e) Use Regulations. All uses permitted in the underlying retail zoning district shall be permitted in the PRO
District, except that the use of Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined in this section, shall be further limited as
follows.
(1) Prohibited Uses. For Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined in this section, the following uses shall be prohibited:
A. Open sales lots, as defined in this section;
B. Filling and service stations;
C. Car washes; and
D. Any business served by a drive-through lane providing access to windows or other facilities at which food
or merchandise can be ordered or picked up, or business can be transacted by a person in a motor vehicle.
(2) Conditional Uses. For Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined in this section, the following uses shall be permitted as Conditional Uses, as approved by the City Planning Commission under the approval criteria provided
in this section:
A. Off-street parking or loading areas;
B. Driveways extending across a public sidewalk;
C. Residential, institutional and non-retail office uses, as defined herein, except that ground-floor entrances and
lobbies serving such uses located on upper floors or in a basement level shall be permitted without the requirement for conditional approval;
D. Any building-enclosed use that does not have a public pedestrian entrance from the Pedestrian Retail Street
Frontage;
E. Any use with more than forty (40) feet of frontage along the Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage; and
F. E. A building with an interior side yard more than four (4) feet in width and located within forty (40) feet
of a Pedestrian Retail Frontage.
(f) Criteria for Conditional Uses. The City Planning Commission shall approve a Conditional Use application if
it determines that the application meets the following criteria:
(1) In the case of a proposed residential, institutional or non-retail office use, one (1) or more of the following conditions apply:
A. The subject building space was designed specifically for the type of use proposed and, as such, occupancy
by an allowed use is an unreasonable expectation;
B. Denial of the application for occupancy by a conditional use would result in a long-term vacancy of the subject property, as demonstrated by the applicant;
C. It has been determined that the proposed use is needed in the immediate area and that suitable alternative
locations are unavailable.
(2) In the case of a proposed off street parking or loading area or driveway, one (1) or both of the following
conditions apply.
A. The size, shape or layout of the subject property does not permit placement of the parking, loading or driveway in a more suitable location.
B. It has been demonstrated by the applicant that placement of the parking, loading or driveway in an allowed
location would jeopardize the continued occupancy of the subject property by uses suited to the PRO District.
(3) In the case of a building enclosed use that does not have an entrance from the Pedestrian Retail Street
Frontage, one (1) or both of the following conditions apply:
A. The proposed use will occupy an existing building that lacks such pedestrian entrance, and the addition of
a conforming pedestrian entrance is made infeasible by the configuration of the interior space or other factors
related to the design and placement of the building.
B. Placement of the pedestrian entrance in a location other than on the Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage will
result in more suitable pedestrian access.
(4) In the case of a proposed use with more than forty (40) feet of frontage along the Pedestrian Retail Street
Frontage, the subject space was designed for use at such size and the proposed use, in the determination of the
City Planning Commission, will not have adverse impacts on the functioning of nearby pedestrian-oriented retail
uses.

July 25, 2018

(5) (4) In the case of an interior side yard more than four (4) feet in width and located within forty (40) feet
of a Pedestrian Retail Frontage, the subject building will be occupied by residential units which require the
greater side yard area to allow for desirable levels of light and air.
(g) Maximum Setbacks. Notwithstanding the provisions of the underlying zoning district, properties in PRO
Districts shall conform to the following regulations with respect to maximum setbacks.
(1) Front Street Yard. No main building on a lot abutting a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage shall be set back
more than five (5) feet from the Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage unless the City Planning Commission has
approved establishment of a surface parking lot in such location as a Conditional Use. Such building features as
entrances and display windows may be set back up to an additional five (5) feet as long as these features occupy no more than fifty percent (50%) of the building's total frontage. These setback regulations shall not apply
to portions of buildings above the first-story level.
(2) Interior Side Yard. No portion of an interior side yard located within forty (40) feet of a Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage shall exceed four (4) feet in width on the ground floor level, unless the City Planning Commission has approved a driveway or a residential side yard in such location as a Conditional Use.
(3) Exceptions for Outdoor Cafes. A building may be set back a maximum of fifteen (15) feet from the Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage in order to accommodate a permanent outdoor café. If use of such café is discontinued for a period of two (2) years or more, the setback area shall be landscaped or otherwise improved in
accordance with a plan approved by the City Planning Commission.
(h) Window Areas. For any nonresidential building or storefront facing a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage,
not less than sixty percent (60%) of the front facade between two and one-half (2-1/2) and seven and one-half
(7-1/2) feet in height shall be composed of transparent windows or doors. In addition, not more than twenty-five
percent (25%) of such window or door area on a building or storefront shall be covered with permanent signs.
(i) Parking. In recognition of the expected greater use of public transit, bicycles and walking by customers
and employees traveling to PRO Districts, the minimum number of parking spaces otherwise required by the Zoning Code shall be reduced by thirty-three percent (33%) for retail business uses in the districts. The Board of
Zoning Appeals may further reduce parking requirements where it has been demonstrated that additional parking is available in common or shared parking facilities or in on-street parking areas located within a reasonable
walking distance of the use, given the nature of the use and the district. The Board shall also consider factors
as the number of bicycle racks available in proximity to a use. In making its determination, the Board shall be
guided by an up-to-date analysis of parking supply and demand and other relevant factors submitted by or on
behalf of the applicant. The City Planning Commission shall maintain a file of all such parking analyses submitted for properties in each PRO District.
(j) Signs in the Public Street Right-of-Way. An ordinance to map a PRO District in a particular location may
include permission to place private signs in the public street right-of-way under the regulations of Chapter 512
of the Codified Ordinances. Such provision shall be included in the PRO designation only if it is determined, on
the basis of a survey and analysis conducted by the City Planning Commission, that the particular PRO District
is characterized by a preponderance of restaurants and small independent stores for which signs placed near the
street curb would provide useful information to pedestrians seeking goods and services and would enhance the
pedestrian-oriented image of the district. Any PRO District designated for display of signs in the street right-ofway shall be shown on the Zoning Map as a “PRO-S” District, with “S” noting the presence of special sign provisions. No sign permitted by these provisions shall be displayed without design approval of the sign's structure
and permanent elements by the City Planning Commission, or where applicable, by the Landmarks Commission.
(k) Variances. The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant variances to requirements of this section under the
applicable criteria stated in Chapter 329 of this code. In the case of an appeal for a variance to permit a drivethrough business in a PRO District, the Board shall consider the following factors based, in part, on a traffic
study performed by the applicant:
(1) The anticipated volume of vehicular use of the proposed drive-through facility, with higher volumes considered to detract from the pedestrian character of the district;
(2) The anticipated proportion of drive-through customer transactions to all transactions at the business, with
over fifty percent (50%) of drive-through transactions indicating that the business is an inappropriate use for a
Pedestrian Retail District.
(3) The impact of the drive-through facility on the pedestrian character of the designated Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage;
(4) The impact on traffic safety and pedestrian safety in the vicinity of the drive-through business.
(l) Appeals. Appeals from the decision of the City Planning Commission to approve or disapprove Conditional
Uses in Pedestrian Retail Spaces shall be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals.

By Mayor Jackson.
An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s desire that Cleveland and Beit Shean and Valley of
Springs, Israel establish a sister city
relationship and authorizing the
Mayor to enter into such agreement
and execute such documents that
are necessary to implement the relationship.
Whereas, Beit Shean, Israel, and
Valley of Springs, which is the
regional government for the area

surrounding the City of Beit Shean
(“Beit
Shean
and
Valley
of
Springs”), are home to approximately 29,000 people; and
Whereas, its residents came to
Israel from many different communities in Europe, North Africa and
the Middle East and like Cleveland,
is a community of immigrants; and
Whereas, in 1995, Beit Shean, Valley of Springs, and the Jewish Federation of Cleveland (the “Federation”) began its partnership and has
grown and deepened over the past
23 years; and
Whereas,
the
Federation
has
invested huge resources into its

1238

work on community and economic
development of Beit Shean and Valley of Springs and has developed
numerous educational and cultural
exchange programs that have connected thousands of Clevelanders to
Beit Shean and Valley of Springs;
and
Whereas, over the past three
years, the Federation brought nonJewish Cleveland leaders to Beit
Shean and Valley of Springs, including civic leaders and community
development professionals, who are
engaged in the Federation’s work in
the St. Clair-Superior neighborhood;
and

July 25, 2018
Whereas, these exchanges are
already yielding specific results in
the areas of youth engagement for
a program that is in development at
the Cleveland Public Library modeled after a Beit Shean teen engagement program, cultural programs
with the possible development of a
program to connect African-American youth with elderly leaders in
the Civil Rights movement and modeled after an existing program that
connects young Jewish adults with
Holocaust
survivors,
and
more,
including additional possibilities for
business-to-business cooperation and
knowledge sharing; and
Whereas, in addition to Clevelanders traveling to Beit Shean, residents of Beit Shean also visit Cleveland annually; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that peace in the world
can only be assured thrugh a
strengthening
of
relationships
among the world’s people; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

By Council Members Griffin, Kelley, Zone, B. Jones, McCormack,
Bishop, Cleveland, Conwell, Johnson, Hairston, J. Jones and Santana.
An emergency resolution establishing a working committee of
Council, the Jackson Administration,
and
community
stakeholders
to
study policies regarding fair application of marijuana charges, further

The City Record
decriminalization, and preparedness
for legalization of recreational marijuana; urging the Ohio General
Assembly to further decriminalize
marijuana possession by lowering
penalties.
Whereas, Ohio cities of Toledo,
Athens, Bellaire, Logan, Newark,
and Roseville have passed ballot
measures by initiative petition campaigns and enacted ordinances that
lowered the penalties for misdemeanor marijuana offenses, including possession of marijuana of 200
grams or less, to no fines or prison
time; and
Whereas, after findings of uneven
enforcement of marijuana charges
against minorities, New York City
responded by halting arrests for
smoking marijuana in public and
convening
a
working
group
to
examining police department policies; Atlanta responded by enacting
an ordinance that lowers the penalty for small amounts of marijuana
possession to a nominal fine with no
prison time; and
Whereas, this Council and the
Administration
will
establish
a
working group, including the Health
Department, Public Safety Department, City Planning Commission,
other law enforcement agencies and
courts,
Council,
and
community
stakeholders to study current policies, determine if a disproportionate
number of charges are brought
against minorities and poor individuals, and consider implementing
policies promoting fairness and further
decriminalization
through
lower penalties; and
Whereas, this working committee
will consider administratively halting marijuana possession arrests
and charges while studying fairness
policies, as well as vacating misdemeanor marijuana-possession convictions in the future, as Seattle
Washington is doing after state
legalization; and
Whereas, the committee will also
study the City’s preparedness for
eventual state legalization of marijuana, including planning for public
safety, health, zoning, economic,
tax, and budgeting effects; and
Whereas, this Council urges the
Ohio General Assembly to further
decriminalize marijuana possession
by lowering penalties and eliminating prison time beyond minor misdemeanor convictions in order to
avoid
unnecessary
incarceration;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council establishes a working committee of Council, the Jackson Administration, and
community stakeholders to study
policies regarding fair application
of
marijuana
charges,
further
decriminalization, and preparedness
for legalization of marijuana; urges
the Ohio General Assembly to further decriminalize marijuana possession by lowering penalties; and
supports a statewide ballot initiative to legalize marijuana.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to send copies of this
resolution to Mayor Frank G. Jackson and the Ohio General Assembly.

Ord. No. 572-18.
By Council Member Brancatelli (by departmental request).
An ordinance to repeal Section 337.031 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by Ordinance No. 1844-02, passed May 12, 2003, relating to Townhouse (RA) Districts; and to supplement the codified ordinances by enacting new Section 337.031, relating to Townhouse (RA) Districts.
Be it ordained by the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 337.031 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by Ordinance
No. 1844-02, passed May 12, 2003, is repealed.
Section 2. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are supplemented by enacting new Section
337.031 to read as follows:
Section 337.031 Townhouse (RA) Districts)
(a) Purpose. Townhouse Districts (i.e., Residential Attached Districts) are established to set the requirements
for the form, site plan and building features of townhouse developments.
Safe sidewalks, inviting streets and compelling urban form are essential elements of vibrant, walkable urban
neighborhoods. The inherent density of townhouses is a key component of this vision, but without thoughtful site
planning and design, this goal will not be fully realized. The provisions of this section are intended to make
these elements the standards for developments in Cleveland’s neighborhoods.
(b) Definitions.
(1) “Townhouse Unit” is a single or two (2) family dwelling on its own lot, served by its own exclusive exterior pedestrian entrance, and attached to one (1) or more other such units by fire walls or fire separation walls.
(2) “Townhouse Building” is a building composed of two (2) or more townhouse units.
(3) “Principal Pedestrian Entrance” is the exterior door exclusive to the dwelling unit that offers a pedestrian
the most visible and direct means of ingress and egress to a public right of way.
(4) “Principal Street Frontage” is the Street Line where the Townhouse Unit’s Principal Pedestrian Entrance
is located. Where a townhouse has a lot line abutting a Public Space, that frontage shall be regulated as a Principal Street Frontage.
(5) "Secondary Street Frontage" means that on corner lots, all street lines that are not the Principal Frontage
are considered Secondary Street Frontages; also known as the side street frontage.
(6) “Interior Frontage” For lots fronting an Alley or without a Street Line, the Interior Frontage is the frontage
of a townhouse where the Principal Pedestrian Entrance is located.
(7) “Frontage build-out” means the portion of the Principal and Secondary Street Frontage containing a building.
(8) “Active Uses” are those habitable spaces of a dwelling most often used for living, eating or cooking. These
spaces encourage ‘eyes on the street’ and include such spaces as living rooms, offices, kitchens, or similar. Nonhabitable spaces, garages, hallways, corridors, bathrooms, closets, storage, mechanical rooms, utility spaces, or
similar are not considered Active Uses.
(9) “Human-scaled materials” are defined as twelve inch (12") maximum width in either the vertical or the horizontal dimension. The other dimension is unlimited. Examples include brick, stone, wood, fiber-cement lap siding, terra cotta, or similar materials.
(c) District Establishment.
The following Townhouse Districts are hereby established: RA-1, RA-2, and RA-3 (with the abbreviation “RA”
indicating “Residential, Attached and the numeral indicating that the districts are listed in order of “densite,”
from lowest to highest.”).
(d) Permitted uses in all RA Districts.
A. Townhouses

Permitted

B. Accessory uses

As permitted in the Two-Family District

(e) Site Planning and Design
No Building Permit shall be issued for the original construction of a townhouse unit or Townhouse Building
without approval of the Director of the City Planning Commission, which shall seek to ensure that the development meets the spirit and intent of division (a) by applying the standards set forth below:
(1) Compatibility. The development shall be visually compatible with nearby properties with respect to such
design elements as scale, height, setbacks, orientation to existing streets, roof lines, architectural character, materials, colors, and proportions of architectural features.
(2) Site Layout. Buildings, structures and landscape features shall be arranged so as to create visual interest,
promote security and personal safety, promote safe, efficient, and comfortable pedestrian circulation, facilitate
safe and efficient vehicular circulation, conserve natural features and provide usable common and private open
space.
(3) Building Features. Townhouse units shall contribute to the character of the neighborhood by drawing from
the best examples of architecture and urbanism. Townhouse units shall be designed to create active, attractive,
street frontages that promote safety and walkability using the essential elements of traditional urban architecture as regulated in division (f) of this code.
(4) Circulation and Parking. Circulation and parking shall be designed to achieve the following:
A. Provide proper access for service and safety vehicles
B. Minimize conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles
C. Minimize the number of curb cuts
D. Maximize opportunities for on-street parking and street trees by prohibiting front loaded garages and unenclosed parking in front yards.
E.
Prohibits placement of garage doors so close to sidewalks as to impair pedestrian safety.
(f) Area, Yard, Siting and Design Regulations.
The following yard and area regulations shall apply in RA-1, RA-2, and RA-3 Districts.

(2) Frontage Diagram

(3) Administrative Modifications. The Director of City Planning may require a numerical standard that is different from the standard under section (f) of up to twenty (20) percent in any direction if it is determined that
such relief will result in a townhouse or townhouse building that is more appropriately situated and/or more consistent with its context. This provision shall not apply to section (f)(3)F.
Example application of Director discretion:
In the RA-3 District the Director may administratively reduce the required Interior Front Yard Depth from the
numerical standard of 7' to 5'7" (7' x 0.8 =5' 7").
(h) Procedures and Appeals
(1) Application of the RA Code. In all zoning districts other than a mapped Townhouse District, proposed townhouse developments shall be reviewed under the RA District whose front yard setback in section (f)(2)A. most
closely matches or complements the zoning district of the proposed development as determined by the Director
of City Planning. To determine which RA District the development shall be reviewed under:
A. Determine the existing typical front yard setback of the zoning district of the proposed development.
B. For proposals to be constructed at mid-block, the RA District whose front yard setback range most closely
aligns with the setback of the existing buildings on the block shall be applied.
C. For proposals to be constructed on corners, context from the buildings on the adjacent corners of the intersection as well as those buildings on the specific block should be considered, and the RA District whose front
yard setback range most closely aligns with the front yard setback of the existing buildings at the intersection
shall be applied.
(2) Townhouses in Single or Two Family Districts. In any zoning district where a townhouse use is not permitted by right (ex. Single Family, Two Family), the City Planning Commission shall determine, based on the
application of division (d) of this Section, if a townhouse use shall be permitted.
Section 3. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by
law.
