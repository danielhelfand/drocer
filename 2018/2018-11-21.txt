Project Description
In 1899, David May, the founder of
May Department Stores, acquired E.
R. Hull & Dutton Co. of Cleveland
on Ontario Street, renaming it May
Company, Cleveland. Built in 1914,
the high-rise building stands 149
feet and contains 8 floors of space,
though floors 7 and 8 were not
added until 1931. The May Company
specialized in mid to higher end
fashion merchandise and home furnishings. May Company was the
first local department store to issue
its own personal charge card in
1965. The building was added to the
National Register of Historic Places
in 1974. However, on January 31,
1993
May
Company,
Ohio
was
merged into Kaufmann’s of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the downtown Cleveland store was closed
The May Company building was
acquired last year for $12 million by
Bedrock-Detroit LLC, a real estate
company. The redevelopment plans
by subsidiary Haddas Windowpane,
LLC , call to convert the property
into 308 apartments, ranging from
one to three bedrooms. The building
also features an interior garage
with entrance off Prospect Avenue
that features 522 spaces on floors
two through five. The roof of the

1940

November 21, 2018
garage on the sixth floor will be
converted into green space open for
residents to use. Other outdoor
spaces on the 9th-floor rooftop space
will enable entertaining, some of
which will be open to the public.
Floor plans call for 40,000 additional square feet of retail, including a
rooftop space for a food-and-beverage tenant. Other retailers would
face Euclid and Prospect and flank
an interior corridor cutting through
the building’s first floor, which
spans more than an acre.

ORC
5709.41 Tax Increment Financing
(TIF) Agreement (Non-School)
The
Department
of
Economic
Development is requesting approval
to enter into a non-school Tax Increment Financing agreement with
Haddas Windowpance LLC to help
the financial feasibility of the project. TIF proceeds are fairly low
because the development qualifies
for a CRA Tax Abatement. These
TIF funds will be used to pay off
debt service associated with the project. This TIF agreement will be up
to 30 years in length. The City will
declare certain improvements with
respect to the project to be a public
purpose and exempt 100% of the
improvements from real property
taxes.
Under
the
agreement,
parcels
acquired and re-conveyed to the
developer will be “TIFed” under section 5709.41 of the Ohio Revised
Code in consideration for the developer
agreeing
to
make
certain
improvements to those parcels, and
agreeing to make payments in lieu
of taxes (PILOT) equal to the taxes
that would have been paid for those
parcels but for the TIF. A portion
of the PILOT will be paid to the
Cleveland Municipal School District
in the amount the District would
have otherwise received but for the
TIF. The Borrower will be responsible for any shortfall of PILOT payments for project costs.
This
piece
of
legislation
is
required by Cleveland City Council
for approval of the TIF Agreement.

Res. No. 1418-18.
By Council Members Conwell and
Kelley.
An emergency resolution strongly
opposing H.B 228, the “stand your
ground” bill.
Whereas, on November 14, 2018,
the Ohio House passed H.B. 228 a
controversial bill that loosens gun
safety standards and expands the
locations at which a person has no
duty to retreat before using force
under both civil and criminal law;
and
Whereas, H.B. 228 shifts the burden to the state to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that a person did
not use force in self-defense; and
Whereas, H.B. 228 was amended to
modify the state’s preemption of
local firearm regulations by preempting municipalities from enacting any kind of firearm restriction,
even if that restriction does not contradict state law; and
Whereas, H.B. 228 was further
amended to allow any citizen who
feels as though a city or village has
infringed on their 2d Amendment
rights to sue the city; if the city is
found guilty, it must pay damages
to that citizen; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that, by removing the duty to
retreat, H.B. 228 makes our communities less safe because the bill
encourages violence instead of urging people to try to avoid violence;
and
Whereas, the bill comes at a time
of unprecedented gun violence in
this country: there have been 307
mass shootings in 311 days; and
Whereas, Ohio students, parents,
families and law enforcement have
asked Ohio legislators to enact common sense gun safety laws; in
response, Ohio House Democrats
offered
a
“red
flag”
gun-safety
amendment - the same measure
introduced by Governor John Kasich
in March, 2018 - but the amendment
was defeated largely on party lines;
and
Whereas, this Council supports
those Ohio state lawmakers that
