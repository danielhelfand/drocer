FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 274-18.
By Council Members Brady and
Kelley.
An emergency resolution opposing
proposed “right to work” Constitutional amendments and supporting
fair labor practices that support
working families and Cleveland’s
economy.
Whereas, special interest groups
are supporting purported “right to
work” Constitutional amendments,
which are actually corporate-backed
attacks on working families and the
middle class; and
Whereas, so-called “right to work”
laws give multi-national corpora-

280

March 7, 2018
tions even more power to outsource
jobs, cut wages and reduce benefits
at the expense of workers, small
businesses and the local economy;
and
Whereas, workers in states with
supposed “right to work” laws have
a consistently lower quality of life
than in other states: lower wages,
higher poverty and infant mortality
rates,
less
access
to
necessary
health care and poorer education for
their children; and
Whereas, these so-called “right to
work” laws weaken the voices of
nurses, firefighters, police officers
and first responders by making it
harder to bargain for safe staffing
levels and necessary safety equipment; and
Whereas,
purported
“right
to
work” laws will silence whistleblowers who are counted on to keep
workplaces safe, protect consumer
goods, services and products and
safeguard natural resources and the
environment; and
Whereas, the implementation of
so-called “right to work” laws will
erode the tax base that supports
vital services in communities, such
as education, public safety, and
infrastructure; and
Whereas, in 2011, Ohio voters
rejected a similar political attack on
Ohio’s workers and the middle class
by overwhelmingly voting “no” on
the “right to work” issue, and this
Council maintains that the collective
bargaining rights of workers should
be protected; and
Whereas,
business
and
labor
should work together to create good
jobs and improve the economy, not
be distracted by outside groups that
want to silence the voices of workers and drive down the middle class;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland
Section 1. That this Council opposes proposed “right to work” Constitutional amendments and supports
fair labor practices that support
working families and Cleveland’s
economy.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to all members of the
Ohio General Assembly and to Governor John Kasich.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
