FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 1258-17
By Council Member Brancatelli.
An emergency resolution urging
the Cuyahoga County Council to
restore the 17 million dollars in the
County Demolition Fund previously
committed to eliminate blighted conditions in the City of Cleveland and
our region.
Whereas, Cuyahoga County Executive, Armond Budish announced
recently that the County will cut the
17 million dollars in demolition
funds previously committed to eliminate blighted conditions in the City
of Cleveland and our region; and
Whereas, these County demolition
funds are the most flexible resource
that helped the City of Cleveland
demolish
condemned
properties
under our blight and nuisance laws
to help stabilize our neighborhoods,
lower crime rates, improve real
estate values, and lower the foreclosure rate; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has an estimated 4,200 residential
structures identified for demolition,
and the elimination of the remaining 17 million dollars from the County Demolition Fund will detrimentally impact the progress the City
has made in eliminating blight
along with their Community Development partners and the Cuyahoga
County Land Bank; and
Whereas, while County Executive
Budish cites other sources of funding for demolition, the City of Cleveland does not receive direct funding
from the Hardest Hit Funds, available only when ownership is first
obtained, and the Neighborhood Initiative Program does not include
demolition; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the progress made in blight elimination so far with the use of County demolition funds, and urges the
Cuyahoga County Council to restore
its commitment to providing the crucial remaining 17 million dollars in
demolition funds of the 50 million
promised and committed as the
County’s portion towards combating
this regional crisis; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Cuyahoga County Council to
restore the 17 million dollars in the
County Demolition Fund previously
committed to eliminate blighted conditions in the City of Cleveland and
our region.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit a copy of
this resolution to Armond Budish,
Cuyahoga County Executive and all
Cuyahoga County Council Members.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1049-17.
By Council Member McCormack.
An emergency resolution declaring the intent to vacate a portion of
West 6th Street.
Whereas, this Council is satisfied
that there is good cause to vacate a
portion of West 6th Street, as
described; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
declares its intent to vacate a portion of the following described real

Situated in the City of Cleveland,
County of Cuyahoga and State of
Ohio and known as being part of

Adopted October 9, 2017.
Effective October 11, 2017.

Res. No. 1210-17.
By Council Members Cummins and
Brady.
An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress and the
President to take immediate action
in their federal relief efforts to
assist the over 3.4 million United
States citizens who live in Puerto
Rico following the devastation of

1789

29
Hurricane Maria on September 20,
2017; and further calling upon the
United States Congress to pass and
the President to sign legislation
allowing
an
economic
hardship
exemption for Puerto Rico from the
Merchant Marine Act of 1920, commonly known as the “Jones Act”.
On Wednesday September 20, 2017
Hurricane Maria, the worst storm to
hit Puerto Rico since 1928, made
landfall, taking out the electric and
telecommunication grid to over 3.4
million American citizens in Puerto
Rico and destroying countless structures in its path; 100% of residential
properties were left without electricity and running water; and
Whereas, according to the Associated Press, 1,360 of the island’s 1600
cell phone towers were destroyed by
Hurricane Maria and 85% of aboveground and underground phone and
internet cables were knocked out
due to the hurricane, making communication to and from the island
to family and friends practically
non-existent; and
Whereas, as of October 1, 2017,
55% of the Puerto Rican population
still does not have drinking water,
95% are still without electricity,
only 14% of cell towers are functioning and 721 of 1,100 gasoline stations are open; and
Whereas, to date Hurricane Maria
has killed 16 people in Puerto Rico
with the death toll likely to rise as
people lack medical care, drinking
water, medical supplies and cooling
units necessary to keep sick and
elderly in stable condition; and
Whereas, last week over 14,000
people were living in shelters, not
including the thousands of homeless
who have moved in with family;
80% of Puerto Rico’s crops have
been destroyed amounting to a $780
million dollar hit to the island’s
agriculture industry; and
Whereas, Hurricane Maria also
breached and destroyed a part of the
Guajataca Dam, endangering the
lives of 70,000 people living near the
dam in San Sebastian and Quebradillas; and
Whereas, the federal government
must make an immediate allocation
to FEMA for Puerto Rico, rather
than waiting for an analysis to allocate funding; further the Army
Corps of Engineers should take the
lead on the potential breach of the
Guajataca Dam and the U.S. Navy
should deploy ships to remove individuals who are sick and need
immediate health services; and
Whereas, the United States must
deploy U.S. military officer, logistics, communication and engineering
assets to help remove debris, clear
roads, and ensure that areas that
have been cut off receive the help
needed; U.S. military are needed to
help preserve law and order, ensure
relief supplies are delivered to those
most in need and protect Puerto
Ricans from crime and looting; and
Whereas, the federal government
must eliminate the formula for Puerto Rico’s federal ceiling on Medicaid
and replace it with a per capita cap
on par with those being proposed in
current health reform bills; the
Affordable Care Act block grant for
Puerto Rico will be depleted this
year and unless there is an influx
of funds, 900,000 Puerto Ricans who
qualified for funding before Hurricane Maria may no longer have
access to health care; and

30
Whereas, the U.S. Department of
Homeland
Security
should
take
steps to accelerate Puerto Rico’s
recovery
from
Hurricane
Maria
including, making the waiver of the
Jones Act a permanent exemption
and also exempting Puerto Rico
from
requirements
that
local
resources
match
federal
funds
expended by FEMA; and
Whereas, the Merchant Marine Act
of 1920, commonly known as the
“Jones Act,” requires that all shipping between United States (U.S.)
ports be conducted by U.S. built,
flagged, crewed and owned vessels;
and
Whereas, Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, is almost entirely reliant on
shipping for the receipt of goods,
therefore, the requirements of the
Jones Act affect the cost of nearly
every product Puerto Ricans consume; and
Whereas, according to the U.S.
Energy Information Administration,
per capita, Puerto Rican energy
usage is two-fifths less than that of
mainland Americans, yet their cost
of
electricity,
approximately
27
cents per kilo-watt hour, is twice the
average cost on the mainland; and
Whereas, a principal reason for
high energy costs is Puerto Rico’s
reliance on expensive petroleum to
generate electricity, due in part, to
the fact that there are only three
Jones Act carriers with a total of
six vessels, available on a limited
basis, that serve Puerto Rico’s bulk
cargo needs, such as petroleum and
grain; and
Whereas, limited availability of
Jones Act qualified bulk cargo carriers has obliged Puerto Rico to
import oil and gas from foreign
sources; and
Whereas, even before Hurricane
Maria, Puerto Rico’s economy was
in great financial distress with an
unemployment rate of 12.6%, which
is more than twice the national
average, and a poverty rate nearly
double that of Mississippi, the poorest state in the Union; an International Monetary Fund report indicates that the Puerto Rican economy has seen virtually no growth
since 1996; Puerto Rico’s government has accrued a debt in excess
of $73 billion dollars; and
Whereas, there is wide consensus
that costs associated with the Jones
Act are a drag on the Puerto Rican
economy and hinder Puerto Rico’s
ability to grow its way out of this
economic crisis, made even worse by
Hurricane Maria; and
Whereas,
exemption
from
the
Jones Act is not without precedent
for United States territories as the
U.S. Virgin Islands are exempt from
the Jones Act; and
Whereas, failure to make Puerto
Rico’s waiver from the Jones Act a
permanent exemption will further
hinder the growth of Puerto Rico’s
economy as it struggles to recover
from the devastation of Hurricane
Maria, would constitute a dereliction
of the federal constitutional obligation to promote the general welfare
of its citizens-3.4 million of whom
inhabit the island of Puerto Ricoand represents a concern for all
Americans; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

The City Record
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Congress and the
President to take immediate action

assist the over 3.4 million United

Section 5. That the Director of
Capital Projects is authorized to
enter into contracts with ODOT prequalified consultants for the preliminary engineering phase of the
Improvement and to enter into contracts with the Director of Transportation necessary to complete the
above described project. Upon the
request of ODOT, the Director of

omissions, and to exercise all other
contractual
rights
