for the requirements for a period of

An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Port Control to
enter into one or more requirement
contracts without competitive bidding with Tyco Simplex-Grinnell to
maintain, repair and expand the integrated fire and security system, for
the various divisions of Port Control,
for a period of two years with two oneyear options to renew, the first of
which is exercisable with additional
legislative authority.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council determines that the within commodities
are non-competitive and cannot be
secured from any source other than
Tyco Simplex-Grinnell. Therefore, the
Director of Port Control is authorized
to make one or more written requirement contracts with Tyco SimplexGrinnell, for the requirements for a
period not to exceed two years with
two one-year options to renew, of the
necessary items of materials, equipment, supplies, and services necessary to maintain, repair, and expand
the integrated fire and security system, to be purchased by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies on a
unit basis, for the various divisions of
the Department of Port Control. The
first of the one-year options to renew
may not be exercised without additional legislative authority. If such
additional legislative authority is
granted and the first of the one-year
options to renew is exercised, then the
second of the one-year options to
renew may be exercised at the option
of the Director of Port Control, without the necessity of obtaining additional authority of this Council.
Section 2. That the costs of the contract or contracts shall be charged
against the proper appropriation
accounts and the Director of Finance
shall certify the amount of any purchase under the contract, each of
which purchases shall be made on
order of the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies by a delivery
order issued against the contract or
contracts and certified by the Director of Finance.
Section 3. That under Section 108(b)
of the Charter, the purchases authorized by this ordinance may be made
through cooperative arrangements
with other governmental agencies.
The Director of Port Control may sign
all documents that are necessary to
make the purchases, and may enter
into one or more contracts with the
vendors selected through that cooperative process. (RQN 3001, RL 2016-34)
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.

An emergency resolution opposing
the Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s
Association’s endorsement of a presidential candidate in this 2016 campaign.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland’s
Division of Police is currently under
a federal consent decree to reform
the department because of years of
engaging in a pattern and practice
of excessive use of force; and
Whereas, the Department of Justice’s report leading to the consent
decree found that the community,
especially the minority community,
distrusts police because of the controversial use of excessive force;
and

1506

Whereas, the Cleveland Police
Patrolmen’s Association does not
usually endorse a candidate for
president; and
Whereas, the endorsement of a
candidate for president given the
DOJ report implies that the police
union does not take seriously the
need for reform and to rebuild trust
between the police department and
community it serves; and

candidate for president while the
city’s division of police is under a
consent decree will only serve to
heighten the community’s distrust of
police and further erode the relationship between officers and minority communities; and

Be it resolved by theCouncil of the

By Council Members Cummins and

An emergency ordinance authorizing Cleveland City Council, through
the President of Council, to enter into
a Memorandum of Understanding
with DigitalC to partner with DigitalC in its technology access and
inclusion project for which DigitalC
is making a grant application to the
MacArthur Foundation.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, notwithstanding
any other ordinance or Codified Ordinance to the contrary, Cleveland City
Council, through the President of
Council, is authorized to enter into a
Memorandum of Understanding with
DigitalC to partner with DigitalC in
its technology access and inclusion
project for which DigitalC is making
a grant application to the MacArthur
Foundation. The Memorandum of
Understanding authorized by this
ordinance shall be substantially in
the following form:
MEMORANDUM OF
UNDERSTANDING
This Memorandum of Understanding is effective on the date last signed
below, by and between DigitalC and
the Cleveland City Council.
Whereas, the John D. & Catherine
T.
MacArthur
Foundation
(“MacArthur Foundation”) is an independent foundation established in
1978 with the goal of building a more
just, verdant and peaceful world;
Whereas, MacArthur Foundation is
seeking, through its 100&Change
competition to solve a critical societal
problem;
Whereas, DigitalC is a 501(c)(3)
tax exempt civic tech organization
that partners with the community to
design technology-driven programs
and services with a diverse team of
experts with experience in technology, start-up’s, strategy, business and
civic tech. DigitalC engages with the
business, technology and civic communities to provide strategies and
programs to enable communities to
support 21st century opportunities for
all. Founded in Cleveland, Ohio, DigitalC aspires to be a leading advocate
for the digital transformation of communities across the nation.
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
Cleveland City Council, the legislative branch of the City of Cleveland,
serves citizens by monitoring city
departments, approving budgets, and

1521

23
enacting legislation to improve the
quality of life in an effective and
financially responsible way.
Whereas, DigitalC, as the project
lead, seeks to collaborate with Cleveland City Council and other community partners to create a scalable and
replicable
model
for
reducing
inequality whereby those who have
experienced structural barriers to
participating in the economy of the
21st century will be able to digitally
access
public
services,
actively
engage in their own health and wellness and drive their own education
and career opportunities (“the Project”).
Whereas, the purpose of this MOU is
to set forth the general terms surrounding the collaboration of the parties to advance the Project.
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties
agree as follows:
1. Compliance with MacArthur
Foundation
100&Change
Grant
Agreement. The parties agree to comply with all terms of the MacArthur
Foundation Grant Agreement.
2. Supervision and Responsibility.
DigitalC will have supervision of the
Project and control over the use of
grant funds. In the event the Project
is awarded funding by the MacArthur
Foundation, Cleveland City Council
will not be a sub-recipient of grant
funds due to the eligibility criteria of
the MacArthur Foundation, pursuant
to this opportunity.
3. Governance. While DigitalC is
the entity ultimately responsible for
management of the Project and the
proper administration of grant funds,
success of this Project depends upon
the engagement and support of the
citizens of Cuyahoga County, and the
valuable knowledge and perspective
of all community partners. To this
end, a Project Board of Advisors shall
be established composed of a representative from the each of the communities impacted, DigitalC, and
each community partner. The Project
Board of Advisors shall provide overall guidance for the implementation
of the Project, including on financing,
financial or other governance issues.
Termination of the MOU is addressed
in paragraph 5 below. Termination of
the Project shall be a decision of last
resort and shall only be made by a
vote of seventy-five percent (75%) of
the voting representatives of the Project Board of Advisors following at
least a six-month period of consideration, which shall include consultation
with the MacArthur Foundation.
Other decisions that affect multiple
parties and that deal with the overall
scope and direction of the Project
shall be subject to approval by the
voting representatives of the community residents, DigitalC and a majority of the voting representatives of the
community partners.
4. Compliance with Laws. The parties will comply with all applicable
federal, state and local laws in connection with the Project.
5. Termination of MOU. The parties
are committed to supporting the Project through the duration of its conception and implementation. The parties are further committed to working
in good faith toward resolution of any
disputes arising under the Project. In
the event of a material breach of the
MOU by either party, the non-breaching party will provide the breaching
party with written notice of the

The City Record

24
alleged breach and allow the allegedly breaching party ninety (90) days to
cure the breach to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching party.
If the allegedly breaching party fails
to cure, or fails to make substantial
steps toward cure in the reasonable
opinion of the non-breaching party
within said ninety (90) day period,
the non-breaching party may then terminate the MOU by providing the
allegedly breaching party thirty (30)
days written notice.
6. Intellectual Property. Ownership
of intellectual property shall follow
U.S. patent law. Ownership of intellectual property created solely by DigitalC will be owned by DigitalC; ownership of intellectual property created solely by the Cleveland City Council will be owned by Cleveland City
Council. Intellectual property created
jointly by DigitalC, Cleveland City
Council, and any other community
partner shall be jointly owned by the
respective creators. The parties agree
to enter into licensing agreements for
the intellectual property with the specific intent of using such intellectual
property to advance the Project. Any
revenue generated from intellectual
property used in the Project will not
result in more than incidental benefit
to any private interests.
7. Responsible Parties. The persons
or their delegates authorized, on
behalf of each party, to speak, act and
execute agreements in connection
with the Project are as follows:
DigitalC:
Name: Lev Gonick
Title: CEO

8. Charitable Purpose. The purpose
of the Project is to create a scalable
and replicable model that creates a
measurable reduction in inequality
through the use of technology for
those in Cuyahoga County with structural barriers to participation in the
21st century economy. The parties
agree that any revenue generated by
the Project will be used to further
advance the Project. No private interests will benefit from the revenue
stream on a basis that is more than
incidental to the primary charitable
purpose to be served by the project.
9. Term and Termination. This MOU
will be in effect for the duration of the
Project.
10. Amendments. No amendment of
any term of this MOU will be effective
unless in writing and executed by
either of the Parties.
11. Assignment. Neither party may
assign this MOU within the written
consent of the other party.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this MOU on the
day and year set forth below by their
respective signatures.
