FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 6-18.
By Council Member Kelley (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 178.10 of the Codified Ordinances, of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
amended by Ordinance No. 2353-93,
passed February 14, 1994, relating to
security for repayment of deposits.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 178.10 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance No. 2353-93, passed February 14, 1994, is amended to read
as follows:
Section 178.10 Security for Repayment of Deposits
(a) The City Treasurer, before
making the initial deposit in an eligible depository designated pursuant to Section 178.03 or before
making an investment in a certificate of deposit pursuant to division

22

January 10, 2018
(b)(8)
of
Section
178.12,
shall
require the eligible depository to
pledge to and deposit with the City
Treasurer, as security for the repayment of all public monies to be
deposited in the eligible depository,
eligible securities in the aggregate
market value equal to one hundred
and ten percent (110%) of the
amount of public monies to be at the
time so deposited. In the case of any
deposit other than the initial deposit
made during the period of designation, the amount of the aggregate
market value of securities required
to be pledged and deposited, shall
be equal to one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the amount of public monies on deposit in such public
depository plus one hundred and ten
percent (110%) of the amount to be
so deposited. The City Treasurer
may require additional eligible securities to be deposited to provide for
any depreciation which may occur
in the market value of any of the
securities so deposited. This paragraph shall not apply to a pooled
security
arrangement
authorized
under division (c) of this section.
(b) The following securities shall
be eligible securities for the purposes of this section:
(1) Bonds, notes or other obligations of or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States
or those for which the faith of the
United States is pledged for the payment of principal and interest thereon, by language specifically appearing therein and not merely by interpretation or otherwise;
(2) Bonds, notes, debentures, or
other
obligations
or
securities
issued by any U.S. government
agency, or the export-import bank of
Washington;
(3) Bonds and other obligations of
the State of Ohio guaranteed as to
principal and interest by the State
of Ohio or those for which the full
faith and credit of the State of Ohio
is pledged for the payment of principal and interest thereon by language specifically appearing therein and not merely by interpretation
or otherwise;
(4) Bonds and other obligations of
any county, township, school district, municipal corporation, including the City, or other legally constituted taxing subdivision of the
State of Ohio, which is not, at the
time of such deposit, in default in
the payment of principal or interest
on any of its bonds or other obligations, for which the full faith and
credit of the issuing subdivision is
pledged;
(5) Obligations guaranteed as to
principal and interest by the Ohio
student loan commission;
(6) A no-load money market mutual fund that is registered as an
investment
company
under
the
“Investment Company Act of 1940,”
54 Stat. 789, 15 U.S.C. 80a-1 to 80a-64,
and that has the highest letter or
numerical rating provided by at
least one (1) nationally recognized
standard rating service, consisting
exclusively of obligations described
in division (b)(1) or (2) of this section
and
repurchase
agreements
secured by such obligations.
(c) The City shall not accept as
eligible securities for purposes of
this section any securities which are
part of a pool of securities authorized in RC 135.181 135.182, unless

January 10, 2018
authorized in advance and in writing by the Director of Finance and
the City Treasurer.
(d) If the eligible depository fails
to pay over any part of the deposit
made therein as provided by law,
the City Treasurer shall sell at public sale any of the eligible securities
deposited with the City Treasurer
pursuant to this section. Thirty (30)
days notice of such sale shall be
given in a newspaper of general circulation within the City of Cleveland. Pursuant to division (C) of RC
135.18, when a sale of eligible securities has been so made and upon
payment to the City Treasurer of
the purchase money, the City Treasurer shall transfer such eligible
securities, whereupon the absolute
ownership of such eligible securities
shall pass to the purchasers, and
any surplus remaining after deducting the amount due the City of
Cleveland and the expenses of sale
shall be paid to the eligible depository.
(e) An eligible depository may, by
written notice to the City Treasurer, designate a qualified trustee and
deposit
the
eligible
securities
required by this section with the
trustee for safekeeping for the
account of the City Treasurer and
the eligible depository, as their
respective rights to and interest in
such securities under this section
may appear and be asserted by written notice to or demand upon the
trustee pursuant to division (D) of
RC 135.18. In such case, the City
Treasurer shall accept the written
receipt of the trustee describing the

The City Record
securities which have been deposited with the trustee by the eligible
depository, a copy of which shall
also be delivered to the eligible
depository. Thereupon all such securities so deposited with the trustee
are, pursuant to division (D) of RC
135.18 deemed to be pledged with
the City Treasurer and to be deposited with him or her, for all the purposes of this section. The qualified
trustee designated to perform the
duties pursuant to this division (e)
must be approved by the Director of
Finance prior to designation by the
eligible depository.
(f) The City Treasurer may make
provisions for the exchange and
release of securities and the substitution of other eligible securities
therefor.
(g) Pursuant to division (I) of RC
135.18, any federal reserve bank or
branch thereof located in the State
of Ohio, without compliance with RC
sections 1109.03, 1109.04, 1109.17 and
1109.18 or any provision of this chapter and without becoming subject to
RC 1109.15 or any other law of Ohio
relative to the exercise by corporations of trust powers generally, is
qualified to act as trustee for the
safekeeping of securities under this
section.
(h) Notwithstanding the fact that
an eligible depository is required to
pledge eligible securities in certain
amounts to secure deposits of public monies, a trustee shall have no
duty or obligation to determine the
eligibility, market value, or face
value of any securities deposited
with the trustee by an eligible

5
depository. This applies in all situations including, without limitation,
a substitution or exchange of securities.

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS REFERRED
Res. No. 5-18.
By Council Members Conwell and
Zone.
An emergency resolution supporting the Vision Zero initiative, a
strategy to eliminate all traffic
fatalities and severe injuries, while
increasing safe, healthy, equitable
mobility for all, and committing to
work with the Jackson administration and community stakeholders to
create a Vision Zero plan for the
City.
Whereas, Vision Zero began in
Sweden as a notably different way
of ensuring that people have the
right to move about their communities safely, setting “zero” as the
“only justifiable fatality target for
road traffic”; and
Whereas, Sweden has one of the
lowest annual rates of road deaths
in the world: 3 out of 100,000; the
annual road death rate in the United States is 12.3 out of 100,000; and
Whereas, in Ohio in 2016, there
were 1,134 traffic fatalities, which is
a 2% increase over 2015; in Ohio,
traffic fatalities have risen 3 years
in a row; and
Whereas, from 2011-2015 in Cuyahoga County there were 120,032
crashes, with the largest percentage
of crashes being in the City: 44% of
total crashes and 38% of fatal and
serious
injury
crashes
were
in
Cleveland during that time period;
and
Whereas, the Vision Zero message
is that traffic-related fatalities and
injuries are neither an inevitable
nor an acceptable side-effect of a
transportation system, but are preventable; and
Whereas, to achieve Vision Zero
there
must
be
a
commitment
between government, relevant agencies and community stakeholders to
cooperate and collaborate; a strong
focus on a systems-based approach
to the environment, practices, and
policies that influence behavior;
efforts to gather, analyze, use, and
share data to understand specific
traffic safety issues and prioritize
resources; and
Whereas, Vision Zero policies or
plans have been adopted by numerous cities in the United States,
including Chicago, New York, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Richmond,
Virginia and Durham, North Carolina; and
Whereas, this Council will establish a Vision Zero taskforce with
the Administration and key stakeholders to help create a Vision Zero
plan for the City of Cleveland to

The City Record
address meaningful changes to traffic enforcement, land use and transportation ordinances; and
Whereas, the City’s Vision Zero
plan will build upon policies that
the City already has in place, including the Complete and Green Streets
legislation, Ordinance No. 798-11,
passed September 19, 2011, and section 433.09 of the Codified Ordinances
which
prohibits
texting
while driving; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Vision Zero initiative, a
strategy to eliminate all traffic
fatalities and severe injuries, while
increasing safe, healthy, equitable
mobility for all, and commits to
work with the Jackson administration and community stakeholders to
create a Vision Zero plan for the
City.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to all members of the
Ohio State legislature, to the Congressional Senators from Ohio, the
Congressional House of Representatives from Cuyahoga County, the
National League of Cities and Bike
Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

Res. No. 24-18.
By Council Members Zone and
Kelley (by departmental request).
An emergency resolution approving the adoption of the Countywide
All Hazards Mitigation Plan for
Cuyahoga County, 2017 Update.
Whereas, hazard mitigation is any
sustainable action taken to reduce
or eliminate damage from future
disaster; and
Whereas, the Disaster Mitigation
Act of 2000 requires all communities
that desire to apply for federal mitigation programs to have an all-natural hazard mitigation plan; and
Whereas, the Disaster Mitigation
Act of 2000 also requires communities to review and revise the plan at
least every five (5) years to reflect
changes in development, progress in
local mitigation efforts, and changes
in priorities, in order to continue eligibility to apply for federal mitigation programs; and
Whereas, the all-natural hazard
mitigation plan must meet the criteria established by the Federal
Emergency
Management
Agency
(“FEMA”); and
Whereas, for disasters that are
declared after November 1, 2004 that
the local government must have an
approved mitigation plan; and
Whereas, in collaboration with
participating jurisdictions, the Cuyahoga County Government, through
the Cuyahoga County Office of
Emergency Management developed

31

13
and maintains such a mitigation
plan which is entitled the “Countywide All Hazards Mitigation Plan
for Cuyahoga County”; and
Whereas,
each
jurisdiction
requesting approval of the plan
must document that the plan has
been formally adopted; and
Whereas, adoption of the “Countywide All Hazards Mitigation Plan”
is a condition of eligibility to
receive federal mitigation funds
available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
approves the adoption of the Countywide All Hazards Mitigation Plan
for Cuyahoga County, 2017 Update.
