Res. No. 587-16.
By Council Member Pruitt.
An emergency resolution supporting
Ohio’s
Energy
Efficiency
Resource and Renewable Portfolio
Standards to create jobs, save consumers money and protect public
health, and urging Governor Kasich
and the Ohio General Assembly to
reinstate these Standards without further delay.
Whereas, in 2008, the State of Ohio
passed
the
Energy
Efficiency
Resource and Renewable Portfolio
Standards that ensures Ohioans have
access to clean, low-cost, and diverse
energy sources; and
Whereas, Ohio’s energy efficiency
programs implemented under the
state’s clean energy standards have
netted Ohio consumers more than $1.5
billion in savings to date and will
result in more than $4.1 billion in savings over the life of the programs; and
Whereas, as of 2016, there were over
100,000 Ohioans working in clean
energy businesses, over 12,000 of
which are located in Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, on average, every dollar
that has been spent on energy efficiency programs in Ohio has resulted
in two dollars in savings for consumers; and
Whereas, many of Ohio’s cities are
taking important action to implement
local clean energy policies and projects to create jobs and deliver residents significant savings on their
energy bills; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland has
embraced sustainability and clean
energy and been an active leader in
energy efficiency and renewable

14
energy deployment through a series
of initiatives and actions over the
past decade to help save residents
money and create jobs; and
Whereas, in 2008, the City of Cleveland adopted a citywide  Advanced
Energy Portfolio Standard; the standard ensures that 15% of  Cleveland
Public Power’s  energy came from
advanced or renewable sources in
2015, 20% by 2020, and 25% by 2025;
and
Whereas, in 2009, the City of Cleveland updated the zoning code regulations to ensure that wind energy facilities are developed and maintained to
maximize utilization of Cleveland’s
wind energy resources while protecting public health, safety and welfare;
and
Whereas, in 2015, through the City
of Cleveland’s Municipal Aggregation Program, 50% of the city’s energy came from renewable sources; this
means that half of each participant’s
electricity usage is backed with
renewable energy credits; and
Whereas, in 2014 the Ohio General
Assembly froze the state Energy Efficiency Resource and Renewable Portfolio Standards for two years and
now, in 2016, there are efforts by some
state lawmakers to continue this
freeze; however, further delay in reinstating the Standards will cost jobs,
deprive consumers of savings, and
increase public health risks; and
Whereas, according to the American Lung Association’s 2016 “State of
the Air” report, the Cleveland metropolitan area still fails to meet the
annual national air quality standard;
and
Whereas, the American Lung Association is calling on Ohio’s leaders to
reinstate the state Energy Efficiency
Resource and Renewable Portfolio
Standards to reduce harmful emissions from power plants that threaten
air quality and harm public health;
and
Whereas, sound clean energy policy creates jobs for the local economy,
provides opportunities for local businesses and residents to save money,
and protects public health through
investments in a low-emissions,
diverse electric grid; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports
Ohio’s
Energy
Efficiency
Resource and Renewable Portfolio
Standards to create jobs, save consumers money and protect public
health, and urges Governor Kasich
and the Ohio General Assembly to
reinstate these Standards without further delay.
Section 2. The Clerk of Council is
directed to transmit copies of this resolution to Governor John Kasich,
Cliff Rosenberger, the Speaker of the
House, Keith Faber, the President of
the Senate, Mike Dovilla, the Chair of
the Ohio House Public Utilities Committee, Al Landis, the Chair of the

Res. No. 515-16.
By Council Member Kazy.
An emergency resolution supporting the Federal Railroad Administration’s proposed ruling requiring that
trains in the United States are operated by a crew of no less than two people.
Whereas, the safe operation of
freight and passenger trains are vital
to commerce in the United States; and
Whereas, the Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA) has published
a notice of proposed rulemaking
regarding adequate staffing on
trains, a factor we believe is vital to
ensuring safe train operations; and
Whereas, polling across America
shows overwhelming bi-partisan support of two-person crews, with 83 to 87
percent of those polled in favor of
mandating that trains be operated by
a crew of at least two qualified individuals; and

The City Record
Whereas, national studies show
that a minimum of two on-board crew
members are vital to operate a train
safely and minimize the likelihood of
train-related accidents; and
Whereas, virtually all trains in
North America are already operated
by crews of at least two individuals,
making the economic impact of this
proposed rule minimal; and
Whereas, the FRA agrees that,
while advancements in automated
technology such as Positive Train
Control systems improve railroad
safety, they are not a substitute for a
train’s on-board crew members; and
Whereas, this Council supports
efforts to keep train operations safe
in the state of Ohio and the entire
country;    
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
supports the Federal Railroad Administration’s proposed ruling requiring
that trains operated in the United
States are operated by a crew of no
less than two people.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to Ralph Leichliter, Legislative Representative Local 284,
Assistant State Legislative Director,
Ohio State Legislative Board SMARTTD for filing with the Federal Railroad Administration.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted May 2, 2016.
Effective May 4, 2016.

Ord. No. 1304-15.
By Council Member Kelley.
An emergency ordinance to establish a Fire and Smoke Damper Inspection Program for buildings owned
and operated by the City, in order to
ensure that fire and smoke dampers
are in proper working order to prevent the spread of fire and smoke
within walls and floors.
Whereas, fire and smoke dampers
are used in HVAC ducts to prevent the
spread of fire and smoke inside the
duct work through walls and floors;
and
Whereas, fire and smoke dampers
are designed to operate automatically
to close off the duct from spread of
fire and smoke, thereby saving lives;
and
Whereas, the majority of fire-related deaths are caused by inhalation of
the toxic gases contained in smoke
produced by fires; and
Whereas, an inspection program is
necessary to guarantee that fire and
smoke dampers are functioning effectively and to protect all City workers,
visitors and safety forces in Cityowned and leased buildings; and
Whereas, a fire and smoke damper
inspection program will ensure that
the City is in compliance with National Fire Protection Association regulations; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for

726

May 11, 2016
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of Public Safety (Director) or his designee
is authorized to establish a Fire and
Smoke Damper Inspection Program
for buildings owned and operated by
the City, in order to ensure that fire

Section 2. The following definitions
shall be used for the Fire and Smoke
Damper Inspection Program:
A. “Fire Damper” means a listed
device installed in ducts and air
transfer openings designed to close
automatically upon detection of heat
and resist the passage of flame. Fire
dampers are classified for use in
either static systems that will automatically shut down in the event of
fire, or in dynamic systems that continue to operate during a fire. A
dynamic fire damper is tested and
rated for closure under elevated temperature airflow.
B. “Smoke Damper” means a listed
device installed in ducts and air
transfer openings designed to resist
the passage of smoke. The device is
installed to operate automatically,
controlled by a smoke detection system and, where required, is capable of
being positioned from a fire command
center.

damper units in buildings owned and
operated by the City shall be tested
and inspected every four (4) years;
the tests and inspections shall be conducted in accordance with National
Fire Protection Association standards. Testing and inspections shall
be conducted by contractors and technicians that have been certified by
the International Certification Board
and American National Standards
Institute to ensure the quality and
knowledge of the inspection process.
Section 4. If any fire and smoke
damper unit is found to be faulty or
inoperable, repairs or replacements
shall begin as soon as possible, with
the goal of completing the repairs
within sixty (60) business days from
the date the unit was found to be
faulty or inoperable. The repairs or
replacements of the fire and smoke
damper units shall be completed and
approved by contractors and technicians who are certified by the International Certification Board and
American National Standards Institute. Compliance with the inspections
and compliance with the repairs or
replacements shall be monitored by
the respective City department that
operates the building under inspection.
Section 5. The Director shall provide a status update to Council within
twelve (12) months of the effective
date of this ordinance, identifying the
buildings already inspected or to be
inspected, the approximate number of
fire and smoke dampers in each building to be inspected, and the proposed
timeline for inspections to ensure
compliance with this ordinance.
Section 6. All testing and inspections
shall be documented indicating the
loc ation of eac h fire and sm oke
damper, date of the inspection, name of
the inspector, deficiencies discovered,

May 11, 2016
and any repairs or replac em ents
completed. The results of the testing
and inspections shall be given by the
technicians to the Director within
thirty (30) days of the completion of
each building tested and inspected.
The Director shall retain these testing
and inspection reports until the next
testing and inspection is completed.
Section 7. Upon twenty-four (24)
months after the effective date of this
ordinance, the Director shall report to
Council, outlining the number of fire
and smoke dampers tested pursuant
to this ordinance, the number of
dampers that needed repaired or
replaced and status of such repairs
and/or replacement. The Director

An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 3 of Ordinance No. 1437-15,
passed December 7, 2015, relating to
reallocating unused pre-2015 HOME
funds to the Housing Trust Fund Program.
Whereas, under 24 CFR §92.500, the
City is required to commit their
HOME allocation within twenty-four
months of HUD’s notification that
they have executed their HOME
Investment Partnership Grant Agreements; and
Whereas, the twenty-four month
period ends on July 31, 2016; and
Whereas,
the
Repair-A-Home
(RAH) and Afford-A Home (AAH)
programs both carry prior year grant
balances; and
Whereas, the Senior Housing Assistance Program (SHAP) was budgeted
with HOME funds, due to its program
design, is better tailored to use CDBG
funds, and therefore, SHAP carries a
grant balance as well; and
Whereas, if pre-2015 HOME funds
are not committed by the July 31, 2016
deadline, 24 CFR §92.500 allows HUD
to reduce or recapture HOME funds in
the amount that are uncommitted
prior to the deadline; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
