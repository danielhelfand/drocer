(a) This section applies to any incinerator used to dispose of refuse or other wastes by burning and to the processing
of salvageable material by burning.
(b) The burning capacity of an incinerator shall be the manufacturer’s or designer’s guaranteed maximum rate or
such other rate as the Commissioner may determine in accordance with good engineering practices. In case of conflict,
the Commissioner’s determination shall govern.
(c) For purposes of this section, the total of the capacities of all operable furnaces within one (1) system constitutes
the incinerator capacity.
(d) No person shall cause or allow to be emitted into the atmosphere, from any incinerator or premises or to pass a convenient measuring point near the stack outlet, particulate matter in the exhaust gases to exceed:
(1) One-tenth (0.10) pound of particulate matter per one hundred (100) pounds of combustible refuse including its ash
and water content charged for incinerators having capacities equal to or greater than one hundred (100) pounds per
hour; or
(2) Two-tenths (0.20) pounds of particulate matter per one hundred (100) pounds of combustible refuse (including its
ash and water content) charged for incinerators having capacities less than one hundred (100) pounds per hour.
(e) No person shall cause or allow the installation or construction of a flue fed, single flue, single chamber incinerator unless such incinerator is equipped with air cleaning equipment to maintain compliance with the emission limitations as established in this Code.

Ord. No. 1472-16.
By Council Members Brancatelli
and Polensek.
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Chapter 686B, Sections 686B.01
through 686B.06 and 686B.99, regulating non-bank automated teller
machines.
Whereas, smash and grab robberies and burglaries are increasingly victimizing Cleveland convenience stores, grocery stores, and
gas station stores, as criminals
drive stolen vehicles into store
fronts to steal non-bank owned automated teller machines (ATMs); and
Whereas, the crime wave is jeopardizing the safety of customers and
store employees, disrupting business, and causing thousands of dollars in store damage and lost ATM
money; and

Whereas, an ATM contains an
average of approximately $10,000,
and the cost of smash and grab
thefts nationwide is estimated at
$288 million per year, including
theft, repair and loss of business
costs; and
Whereas, regulating the placement and installation of ATMs, and
requiring
security
measures
at
stores, including security cameras,
lighting, bollards, and GPS trackers
on ATMs, will deter criminals from
committing smash and grab robberies at easy targets and help
catch criminals; and
Whereas,
Senator
Tom
Patton
introduced Senate Bill No. 335 pending in the Ohio Senate that would
require the superintendent of financial institutions to adopt rules to
regulate the placement of automated teller machines and regulate the
servicing
of
automated
teller
machines, including how often cash

1853

is replenished and more frequent
servicing with smaller amounts of
cash; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
wants to protect citizens and prevent smash and grab robberies by
regulating
installation,
requiring
security measures, and requiring
more frequent servicing of non-bank
owned automated teller machines;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
