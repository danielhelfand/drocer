child care facility, or school on which

1448

August 23, 2017
the
original
construction
was
completed prior to January 1, 1978,
shall be presumed to be lead-based.
This presumption may be rebutted and
recorded by doing the following:
(1) Obtain a certification from a
lead-based paint inspector or risk

hazard, in place of the testing
requirements of OAC 3701-32-07(G)(8);
D. If the lead risk assessor identifies
a lead hazard in section OAC 3701-3207(G)(10)(n) of the report, the report

care facility, or school is “not lead
safe.” If the lead risk assessor does not
identify any lead hazards in section

report, the report must prominently
state on the first page that the
residential unit, child care facility, or

the residential unit, child care facility,
or school shall file an application for

Housing as a public record, except
those portions that are prohibited from
being released by state or federal law.
(f) Effectiveness Period.
(1) A Lead Safe Certificate shall be
valid for two years from the date of
issuance except as provided for in
division (f)(2) of this section.

shall continue to meet the disclosure
requirements of section 240.06 and, as

The City Record
facility, or school. Failure to maintain
compliance
will
result
in
the
revocation of the Lead Safe Certificate
by the Director of Building and
Housing.
(g) Compliance Monitoring. All
residential rental properties, child
care facilities and schools may be
subject to inspection for the purpose of
determining compliance with the
provisions of this Code and all other
applicable laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations. Inspections may be
conducted on a random basis or based
on a reasonable suspicion that the lead
safe certification was not completed in
compliance with the provision of this
Code.
(h) Legal Presumption. The Lead
Safe Certificate entitles the owner,
manager, or agent of the residential
unit, child care facility, or school to a
legal presumption that the residential
unit, child care facility, or school is not
the source of the lead poisoning of an
individual who resides in the unit or
receives child-care or education at the
facility or school. The owner of the
residential unit, child care facility, or
school
shall
comply
with
the
provisions of this section applicable to
obtaining a Lead Safe Certificate to be
entitled to that presumption. The legal
presumption established under this
section applies to any enforcement
action under this Code and is
rebuttable in a court of law only on a
showing of clear and convincing
evidence to the contrary.
(i) Transfer of Certificate. When a
person obtains both equitable title and
legal possession of a residential unit,
child care facility, or school covered
by a Lead Safe Certificate, any
certificate issued to the previous
owner is no longer in effect unless the
following requirements are met:
(1) The new owner submits a signed
and dated written notice of the change
in ownership of the residential unit,
child care facility, or school to the
Department of Building and Housing
within sixty (60) days after the date

the residential unit, child care facility,
or school covered by the certificate.
The owner’s name and mailing
address shall be provided in the notice;
(2) The new owner complies with
the conditions for maintaining the
certificate under this chapter.
(j) Conflict of Interest. A Lead Safe
Certificate is not valid unless the lead
risk assessor, lead risk investigator or
clearance technician certifying that
the residential unit, child care facility,
or school that is certified meets the
following criteria:
(1) The assessor or technician is not
the owner or manager or an immediate
family member, agent or employee of
the owner or manager;
(2) The assessor or technician is not
part of a company or associated with
a company that is directly or
beneficially owned, controlled or
managed by the owner or manager, or
by an immediate family member,

a person hired by or under contract
with the owner to manage or maintain

of
whether

August 23, 2017
An emergency resolution opposing
the proposed ban of transgender
people in the military.
Whereas, on July 26, 2017, the
President
of
the
United
States
announced, in a series of tweets, his
plans to bar transgender Americans
from serving in the US military; and
Whereas, this proposed ban would
keep transgender individuals from
serving in any branch of the military in any capacity; and
Whereas,
this
proposed
ban
wrongfully and unreasonably denies
the rights of patriotic and brave
transgender men and women to
serve our country and pursue a
rewarding
public
service
career
path; and
Whereas, further, the proposed
ban deprives our country of the talent and skills that transgender
troops provide and will weaken our
overall military readiness; and
Whereas, 56 retired generals and
admirals from every branch of the
military signed a letter opposing the
proposed
ban
saying:
“Patriotic
transgender
Americans
who
are
serving or want to serve must not
be dismissed, deprived of medically
necessary health care, forced to compromise their integrity or hide their
identity”; and
Whereas, we must remain diligent
in the fight against discrimination,
and support equal rights for all,
regardless of race, gender, religion,
sexual orientation or gender identification; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the proposed ban of transgender
people in the military.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to the President of the
United
States,
all
members
of
Congress, Governor John Kasich and
all members of the Ohio House and
Senate.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Motion to suspend rules, Charter,
and statutory provisions and place
on final adoption.

An emergency resolution opposing
the proposed ban of transgender
people in the military.
Whereas, on July 26, 2017, the
President
of
the
United
States
announced, in a series of tweets, his
plans to bar transgender Americans
from serving in the US military; and
Whereas, this proposed ban would
keep transgender individuals from
serving in any branch of the military in any capacity; and
Whereas,
this
proposed
ban
wrongfully and unreasonably denies
the rights of patriotic and brave
transgender men and women to
serve our country and pursue a
rewarding
public
service
career
path; and
Whereas, further, the proposed
ban deprives our country of the talent and skills that transgender
troops provide and will weaken our
overall military readiness; and
Whereas, 56 retired generals and
admirals from every branch of the
military signed a letter opposing the
proposed
ban
saying:
“Patriotic
transgender
Americans
who
are
serving or want to serve must not
be dismissed, deprived of medically
necessary health care, forced to compromise their integrity or hide their
identity”; and
Whereas, we must remain diligent
in the fight against discrimination,
and support equal rights for all,
regardless of race, gender, religion,
sexual orientation or gender identification; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the proposed ban of transgender
people in the military.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to the President of the
United
States,
all
members
of
Congress, Governor John Kasich and
all members of the Ohio House and
Senate.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

An emergency ordinance authorizing the Directors of Community
Development
and/or
Economic
Development to enter into an agreement
with
Cleveland
Citywide
Development
Corporation,
or
its
designees, to implement several programs in order to improve housing
opportunities in the neighborhoods
of the City of Cleveland.
Whereas, the City wants to spur
investment in areas that have not seen
private investment; and
Whereas, in many neighborhoods, it
is market and cost forces, rather than
lack
of
interest
that
impedes
development; and

1494

August 23, 2017
Whereas,
challenge
to
secure
traditional bank financing in many
neighborhoods because the cost of
construction far exceeds the appraised
value of properties; and
Whereas, in order to develop infill
housing in neighborhoods, programs
are required to write down costs of
construction towards appraised value
and a mix of construction subsidies
and
homeowner
subsidies
are
required; and
Whereas, Detroit has had some
success with a Home Mortgage
Program, which provides guaranteed
second mortgages to help write down
these costs and banks have indicated
a willingness to replicate this model in
Cleveland; and
Whereas, banks will participate on
construction
loans
for
strong
developers with sufficient subsidy;
and
Whereas, down payment assistance
will help homeowners meet equity
requirements; and
Whereas, it is the goal to fund up to
75 new houses in targeted areas, with
a
mix
of
new
construction,
rehabilitation for new occupancy and
homeowner rehabilitation;
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Directors of
Community

of the City of Cleveland in areas
identified
through
the
Housing
Advisory Board.
Section 2. That for new construction,
the City will identify target areas and
work with CCDC on the selection of
developers by RFP and funding will
be provided on a project-by-project
basis;
for
homeowner
mortgage
guaranties
and
down
payment
assistance, funds will be limited to
houses constructed or rehabilitated
through Chapter 176 bonds and banks
will provide underwriting for first
mortgages and second mortgages, and
CCDC will review bank underwriting
for guaranties and down payment
assistance;
for
homeowner
rehabilitation, CCDC will underwrite,
subject to City approved guidelines as
further defined in Section 7; and
Section 3. That the agreement shall
provide for the administration of a
Housing Development Fund, which
will make loans and forgivable loans
for the construction of new housing
and rehabilitation of existing housing.
Any loans entered into under this
section
shall
require
additional
legislative authority.
Section 4. That the Agreement shall
provide for the administration of a

Mortgage
Guaranty
Program,
which
will
provide
guaranties for mortgages to be
provided to purchases of housing

shall be subject to the approval of the
Housing Advisory Board.
Section 9. That the Director of
Economic Development is authorized
to accept such collateral as the
director determines is sufficient in
order to secure repayment of the loan.
Section 10. That the costs of the
agreement shall not exceed $5,650,000
and shall be paid from Fund No. 20 SF
567. (Request No. RQS 9501, RLA 201715)
