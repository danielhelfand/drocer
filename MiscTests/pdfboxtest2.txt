the usual daily operation of a munici-
pal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 630.02 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, as amended by Ordinance
No.141.09, passed March 30, 2009, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 630.02  Action to Abate
Nuisances; Costs of Enforcement
(a) Notice of Declaration of Nui-
sance. The Director of Public Safety
or his or her designee, upon finding
that three (3) or more nuisance activ-
ities as defined in Section 630.01 have
occurred on separate occasions with-
in any twelve (12) month period on
the same property, may cause a writ-
ten notice and order to be served on
the owner of the property declaring
that the property is a nuisance prop-
erty. This notice and order shall iden-
tify the nuisance activities, and the
estimated costs to abate any future
nuisance activity; shall state that the
owner may avoid being charged the
costs of abatement by taking steps to
prevent any further nuisance activity
as set forth in division (d) of this sec-
tion; and shall state the appeal
process. The notice shall further state
that if a fourth or subsequent nui-
sance activity as defined in Sec-
tion 630.01 occurs later than thirteen
(13) days after the date of the written
nuisance declaration notice and with-
in twelve (12) months of the date of
the third or any subsequent nuisance
activity, the City may abate the nui-
sance by responding to the activities
using administrative and law
enforcement actions, and the costs of
the abatement shall be charged to the
owner of the nuisance property and
may be certified as a lien on the nui-
sance property. Notice shall be
deemed properly delivered by deliver-
ing it personally to the owner or leav-
ing it at the owner’s usual place of
business or residence, or by mailing it
to the owner, or, if it cannot be served
in any of the other ways mentioned
above, by publishing it once in a
newspaper of general circulation
within the City, or by posting it in a
conspicuous place on the real estate
involved.
(b) Abatement.  If the Director of
Public Safety or his or her designee
determines that a fourth or subse-
quent nuisance activity as defined in
Section 630.01 occurs later than thir-
teen (13) days after the date of the
initial written nuisance declaration
notice and within twelve (12) months
after the date of the third or any sub-
sequent nuisance activity, the City
may abate the nuisance activity by
using administrative and law
enforcement actions, and the costs of
the abatement shall be charged to the
owner of the property and, if not paid,
may be certified by the Commissioner
of Assessments and Licenses to the
County Auditor to be placed on the
nuisance property as a lien to be col-
lected as other taxes and returned to
the City. The cost to abate the nui-
sance activity shall be calculated as
set forth in division (c). The City
shall provide notice to the owner of
the nuisance property of the City’s
decision to charge the cost of abate-
ment. If the costs are not paid by the
owner, the City shall notify the owner
at least thirty (30) days before the
costs are certified to the County Audi-
tor. The notice shall contain a street
address or legal description of the
property, a description of the nui-
sance activities and the cost to abate.
Notices shall be served as set forth in
division (a) of this section. The Direc-
tor of Law may take any other action
necessary to collect the costs of abate-
ment.
(c) Costs of Abatement.  Costs of
abatement shall be determined based
on the time required to respond to the
nuisance activity multiplied by an
hourly rate based upon the wages and
benefits of a police officer, dispatch
costs, vehicle and equipment costs,
and supervisory and administrative
costs. The hourly rate may be adjust-
ed based on the number of police offi-
cers required to abate the nuisance.
(d) Nuisance Abatement Plan. The
owner of a nuisance property may
avoid being charged the cost of abat-
ing future nuisances if the owner
meets with the Director of Public
Safety or his or her designee; presents
a plan to prevent further nuisance
activity and that plan is approved by
the Director of Public Safety or his or
her designee; and implements the
plan.
(e) Appeal.  The owner of a nui-
sance property who receives a notice
declaring the owner’s property to be a
nuisance property, a notice charging
the cost of abating nuisance activity,
or a notice that the cost of abatement
shall be certified to the County Audi-
tor, may appeal the notice by submit-
ting a written request to the City offi-
cial who issued the notice within ten
(10) days of the date of the notice. If,
after a decision on that appeal, the
owner disagrees with the decision,
the owner may appeal the decision of
the City official to the Board of Zon-
ing Appeals. An appeal to the Board

render a decision in accordance with
City ordinances and regulations gov-
erning its conduct and procedure. An

cause to believe that each nuisance
activity stated in the notice being
appealed has occurred, and that the

sance property is justified. In an
appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals of a notice charging the cost
of abating nuisance activity, or a
notice that the cost of abatement

tor, the City must show by a prepon-
derance of the evidence that the
charging of abatement costs or the
certification of abatement costs is
justified. The owner may prevail on
appeal of any notice if the owner
demonstrates by a preponderance of
the evidence that:
(1) He or she was not the owner at
the time of any of the nuisance activi-
ty that is the basis of the notice; or
(2) He or she had knowledge of the
nuisance activity, but promptly and
vigorously took all actions necessary

declaration of the property as a nui-
sance property, he or she promptly
took all actions necessary to abate
the nuisance including, without limi-
tation, compliance with the require-
ments of division (C) of RC 5321.17
and division (A)(9) of RC 5321.04.

ing lot in a B1 Two-Family Resi-
dential District. The owner appeals

Cleveland Codified Ordinances:
1. Section 337.03 which states that
in a Two-Family District a parking
lot is not a permitted use.
2. Section 349.13(c) which states
that The Board of Zoning Appeals
may permit, temporarily or perma-
nently, the use of land in a Resi-
dence District, other than a Limited
One- Family District, for a parking
lot when the best interests of the
community will be served, and pro-
vided that:
(1) The lot is to be used only for
the parking of passenger automo-
biles of employees, customers or
guests of the person or firm con-
trolling and operating the lot, who
shall be responsible for its mainte-
nance;
(2) No charge is to be made for
parking on the lot;
(3) The lot is not to be used for
sales, repair work or servicing of
any kind;
(4) Entrance to and exit from the
lot are to be located so as to do the
least harm to the Residence District;
(5) No advertising sign or mater-
ial is to be located on the lot;
(6) All parking is to be kept back
of the setback building line by bar-
rier unless specifically authorized
otherwise by the Board;
(7) The parking lot and that por-
tion of the driveway back of the

screened from the street and from
adjoining property in a Residence
District by a hedge, sightly fence or
wall not less than four (4) feet six
(6) inches high and not more than
five (5) feet high located back of

ing is to be arranged so that there
will be no glare that is annoying to
the occupants of adjoining property
in a Residence District, and the sur-
face of the parking lot is to be
smoothly graded, hard surfaced and
adequately drained;
(8) The building permit number
under which the lot is established is
to be posted;
(9) Such other and further condi-
tions may be imposed as the Board
may deem necessary in any specific
case to reduce the adverse effect of
the proximity of a parking lot upon
the character, development and
maintenance of the Residence Dis-
trict in which the parking lot is to

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 587-16.
By Council Member Pruitt.
An emergency resolution support-
ing Ohio’s Energy Efficiency
Resource and Renewable Portfolio
Standards to create jobs, save con-
sumers money and protect public
health, and urging Governor Kasich
and the Ohio General Assembly to
reinstate these Standards without fur-
ther delay.
Whereas, in 2008, the State of Ohio
passed the Energy Efficiency
Resource and Renewable Portfolio
Standards that ensures Ohioans have
access to clean, low-cost, and diverse
energy sources; and
Whereas, Ohio’s energy efficiency
programs implemented under the
state’s clean energy standards have
netted Ohio consumers more than $1.5
billion in savings to date and will
result in more than $4.1 billion in sav-
ings over the life of the programs; and
Whereas, as of 2016, there were over
100,000 Ohioans working in clean
energy businesses, over 12,000 of
which are located in Cuyahoga Coun-
ty; and
Whereas, on average, every dollar
that has been spent on energy effi-
ciency programs in Ohio has resulted
in two dollars in savings for con-
sumers; and
Whereas, many of Ohio’s cities are
taking important action to implement
local clean energy policies and pro-
jects to create jobs and deliver resi-
dents significant savings on their
energy bills; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland has
embraced sustainability and clean
energy and been an active leader in
energy efficiency and renewable
energy deployment through a series
of initiatives and actions over the
past decade to help save residents
money and create jobs; and
Whereas, in 2008, the City of Cleve-
land adopted a citywide  Advanced
Energy Portfolio Standard; the stan-
dard ensures that 15% of Cleveland
Public Power’s  energy came from
advanced or renewable sources in
2015, 20% by 2020, and 25% by 2025;
and 
Whereas, in 2009, the City of Cleve-
land updated the zoning code regula-
tions to ensure that wind energy facil-
ities are developed and maintained to
maximize utilization of Cleveland’s
wind energy resources while protect-
ing public health, safety and welfare;
and
Whereas, in 2015, through the City
of Cleveland’s Municipal Aggrega-
tion Program, 50% of the city’s ener-
gy came from renewable sources; this
means that half of each participant’s
electricity usage is backed with
renewable energy credits; and
Whereas, in 2014 the Ohio General
Assembly froze the state Energy Effi-
ciency Resource and Renewable Port-
folio Standards for two years and
now, in 2016, there are efforts by some
state lawmakers to continue this
freeze; however, further delay in rein-
stating the Standards will cost jobs,
deprive consumers of savings, and
increase public health risks; and
Whereas, according to the Ameri-
can Lung Association’s 2016 “State of
the Air” report, the Cleveland metro-
politan area still fails to meet the
annual national air quality standard;
and
Whereas, the American Lung Asso-
ciation is calling on Ohio’s leaders to
reinstate the state Energy Efficiency
Resource and Renewable Portfolio
Standards to reduce harmful emis-
sions from power plants that threaten
air quality and harm public health;
and
Whereas, sound clean energy poli-
cy creates jobs for the local economy,
provides opportunities for local busi-
nesses and residents to save money,
and protects public health through
investments in a low-emissions,
diverse electric grid; and
Whereas, this resolution consti-
tutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council sup-
ports Ohio’s Energy Efficiency
Resource and Renewable Portfolio
Standards to create jobs, save con-
sumers money and protect public
health, and urges Governor Kasich
and the Ohio General Assembly to
reinstate these Standards without fur-
ther delay.
Section 2. The Clerk of Council is
directed to transmit copies of this res-
olution to Governor John Kasich,
Cliff Rosenberger, the Speaker of the
House, Keith Faber, the President of
the Senate, Mike Dovilla, the Chair of
the Ohio House Public Utilities Com-
mittee, Al Landis, the Chair of the

Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all

Ohio 44102, Permanent Number

ing for the usual daily operation of a

fore,

enacted by Ordinance No. 522-08,
passed June 9, 2008, relating to bicy-
cle parking.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a munici-
pal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 457.10 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, as enacted by Ordinance
No. 522-08, passed June 9, 2008, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 457.10 Bicycle Parking
As a condition of the issuance or
renewal of an annual license, all
parking lots and garages subject to
the provisions of this chapter shall
provide spaces for bicycle parking in
accordance with the following regula-
tions.
(a) Purpose. The requirements for
bicycle parking are established for
the purpose of ensuring adequate and
safe facilities to accommodate bicycle
parking and to encourage use of bicy-
cles for travel as an alternative to use
of motorized vehicles.
(b) Time of Compliance. For applic-
able parking lots and garages that
were licensed prior to the initial effec-
tive date of this section, required bicy-
cle parking spaces shall be provided
no later than two (2) years after the
initial effective date of this section.
For other applicable parking lots and
garages, required bicycle parking
spaces shall be provided prior to the
issuance of a license.
(c) Number of Bicycle Parking
Spaces. Bicycle parking spaces shall
be provided at a rate of one (1) bicy-
cle parking space for each twenty
(20) automobile spaces provided.
However, no automobile parking lot
or garage shall be required to provide
more than twenty-four (24) bicycle
parking spaces.
(d) Substitution for Automobile
Spaces. The total number of automo-
bile off-street parking spaces
required under the Zoning Code shall
be reduced at the ratio of one (1) auto-
mobile off-street parking space for
each six (6) bicycle spaces provided.
The total number of required automo-
bile off-street parking spaces, howev-
er, shall not be reduced by more than
five percent (5%) for any parking lot
or garage.
(e) Bicycle Parking Space Size.
Required bicycle parking spaces for
nonresidential uses must have mini-
mum dimensions of two (2) feet in
width by six (6) feet in length.
(f) Bicycle Parking Space Loca-
tion. Required bicycle parking spaces
shall be located at least as close to the
entrance of the building as the near-
est non- handicapped automobile
parking space. Where automobile
parking is provided in an enclosed
area, bicycle parking shall be provid-
ed within the enclosure or in such a
way as to provide comparable protec-
tion from the elements.
(g) Bicycle Racks and Lockers.
Each required bicycle parking space
shall be equipped with a bicycle rack
or “bicycle locker,” as defined in this
section.
(1) Design. Bicycle racks and lock-
ers must be securely anchored to the
ground or a building. Bicycle racks
must provide a stable frame to which
the bicycle may be conveniently
secured, such as the inverted-U, post
and loop, or another type of rack that
meets these standards. Bicycle racks
that support the wheel but not the
frame of the bike may not be used to
fulfill a bicycle parking requirement.
In parking lots and parking garages,
physical barriers, such as posts or bol-
lards, shall be provided so as to pre-
vent a motor vehicle from striking a
parked bicycle.
(2) Residential Uses. Neither bicy-
cle racks nor bicycle lockers are
required for bicycle parking associat-
ed with residential uses. Required
bicycle parking for residential uses
may be provided in garages, storage
rooms, or any other resident-accessi-
ble, secure areas.
(h) Bike Locker. As used in this sec-
tion, “bike locker” means a locker or
storage space large enough to house a
single bicycle and which may be
secured and accessed by a single user.
(i) Alternate Locations and Number
of Spaces. For public parking garages
and parking lots legally established
prior to June 9, 2008, the Director of
the City Planning Commission may
approve locations other than the
garage or lot for the required bicycle
parking spaces or less than the
required number of bicycle parking
spaces if the Director determines
that, under the following circum-
stances, alternate locations or num-
ber of bicycle parking spaces would
better meet the stated purpose of this
Section:
(1) A single entity controls multi-
ple parking garages or parking lots
that serve the same business or use; 
(2) The aggregate number of bicy-
cle parking spaces for the multiple
parking garages or parking lots that
serve the same business or use will
meet or exceed the bicycle parking
requirements under this Section;
(3) A location on another property
or in the public right-of-way repre-
sents the only feasible means to meet
the requirement for bicycle parking
spaces. A location in the public right-
of-way shall be permitted only if such
location meets all requirements for
issuance of an Encroachment Permit.
Section 2. That Section 457.10 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, as enacted by Ordinance
No. 522-08, passed June 9, 2008, is
repealed.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirma-
tive vote of two-thirds of all the mem-
bers elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by the
