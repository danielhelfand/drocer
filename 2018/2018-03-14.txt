FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 305-18.
By Council Members Kelley, J.
Jones, Bishop, McCormack, Johnson,
Cleveland,
Griffin,
B.
Jones,
Polensek, Conwell, Hairston, Brady,
Brancatelli, Santana, Zone, Kazy
and Keane.
An emergency resolution supporting the passage of the Health &
Human Services levy renewal on
Tuesday May 8, 2018.
Whereas, the 2018 renewal of
Cuyahoga County’s 3.9-mill Health &
Human Services levy will ensure
that children, seniors, families and
people in crisis continue to receive
critical services; and
Whereas, revenues generated by
the Health & Human Services levy
support:
• Emergency services like MetroHealth’s
premier
Level
One
Trauma and Burn Center;
• MetroHealth Life Flight and
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit;
• Services and programs to protect children at risk of abuse or
neglect;
• Home health care and services
to help senior citizens live independently;
• Counseling and treatment programs for children with behavioral health or drug problems;
• Pre-kindergarten
and
health
programs to make sure children

The City Record

6
enter school healthy, prepared
and ready to learn; and
• Crisis services for our most vulnerable citizens, whenever the
need arises.
Whereas, the Health & Human
Services levy is a critical piece of
our community safety net, available
for all of us at any time; and
Whereas, without voter approval
of the Health & Human Services
levy, these programs will lose $200
million in funding, forcing deep cuts
to vital emergency services and programs that protect children, provide
a variety of services that seniors
depend on and help people living
with mental illness; and
Whereas,
the
2018
Health
&
Human Services levy renewal is not
a tax increase; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the far-reaching importance of the
passage of the Health and Human
Services Levy; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland
Section 1. That this Council supports the passage of the Health &
Human Services levy renewal on
Tuesday May 8, 2018.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Cuyahoga
County
Executive
Armond
Budish.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

issuance of special event permits,
including without limitation a prior
notice requirement, first-come, firstserved scheduling, limitations on
frequency of use, and limitation of
permits to normal operating hours
for City property. Use of the City
Hall Rotunda for events other than

(1) maintain records of all vendors associated with the event,
including the name, address, phone
number, and description of all items
to be sold; and
