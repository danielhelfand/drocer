Res. No. 733-16.
By Council Members Brancatelli
and Kelley.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Housing Finance Agency
(OHFA) to direct sufficient Hardest
Hit Funds to Cuyahoga County for
blight demolition.
Whereas, in February, the U.S.
Treasury awarded Ohio $97,590,720 in
additional Hardest Hit Fund money, a
substantial portion of which will be
devoted to blight demolition under
the next funding round of OHFA’s
Neighborhood Initiative Program
(NIP); and
Whereas, while many counties
have considerable needs, Cuyahoga
County has both the need and capacity to utilize these funds; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County has
robust acquisition capacity to meet
complex and time-consuming NIP
requirements that county land banks
take title to properties before the
demolitions can occur; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County has
consistently moved more than 1,500
vacant houses per year through expedited tax foreclosure, according to the

The City Record
Plain Dealer, and the county prosecutor is now hiring ten additional
employees so that many more blighted houses will pass through expedited tax foreclosure over the next three
years; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County’s financial capacity has been enhanced by
county government’s decision last
year to commit $50 million of county
revenue to further blight removal;
and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County also
has demolition capacity, having
demolished 1,169 of the 2,168 houses
approved for funding reimbursement,
thus demonstrating 54% of statewide
demolition capacity to date; and
Whereas, the U.S. Treasury prioritized institutional capacity to spend
the funds for this funding round, stating in U.S. Treasury’s February 19th
press release, “. . . [U.S. Treasury] will
prioritize states that have demonstrated the ability to effectively
deploy funds”; and
Whereas, given that the U.S. Treasury’s key priority in making allocation decisions amongst the states was
capacity, OHFA should be guided by
the same in making its sub-allocations amongst the counties; and
Whereas, this Council appreciates
OHFA’s leadership on the critical
work of removing blight from Ohio’s
communities, and urges OHFA to
make capacity the key priority in
making allocation decisions for the
next round of NIP funding, and
accordingly direct sufficient funds to
Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio Housing Finance Agency
(OHFA) to direct sufficient Hardest
Hit Funds to Cuyahoga County for
blight demolition.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit a copy of this
resolution to Douglas A. Garver,
Executive Director, Ohio Housing
Finance Agency.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

lodging. The tax required to be collected under this chapter shall be
deemed to be held in trust by the vendor or the City until paid to the
Administrator, as provided in Section

the transient guest to pay such tax
directly to the Administrator.

transient occupancy tax, and the vendor shall not be responsible for collecting the transient occupancy tax
on any transaction for which the vendor has received confirmation that
the booking agent has collected and

fifteen (15) days upon notification in
writing to the vendor or booking
agent and shall be preserved for a
period of three (3) years, unless the
Administrator in writing consents to
their destruction within that period,
or by order requires that they be kept

of the United States, the State, the
County, the City, for official use only,
or except as required by law.

deems it necessary in order to insure
the payment of the tax imposed by

month.

Section 193.06 Tax to be Separately
Stated and Charged
(a) The vendor or booking agent
collecting for a vendor shall state and
charge the transient occupancy tax to
the transient guest separately from
the charge for the lodging and on any
record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted
and charged for, and upon every evidence of occupancy or any bill or
statement or charge made for occupancy issued or delivered by the vendor.
(b) No vendor or booking agent
shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly,
that the tax or any part thereof will
be assumed or absorbed by the vendor
or booking agent, or that the tax will
not be added to the amount charged
for the lodging, or that, if added, any
part will be refunded except in the
manner provided in this chapter.

Section 193.08 Refunds
The Administrator shall refund or
grant credits to vendors or booking
agents collecting for vendors for the
amount of tax paid illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous assessment where the vendor
or booking agent has not reimbursed
itself from the transient guest. As
between a vendor and a booking
agent, the request for refund shall be
made by the party that filed the
return containing the illegal or erroneous assessment. A transient guest
may obtain a refund or credit for the
amount of taxes paid illegally or erroneously, but only when the tax was
paid by the transient guest directly to
the Administrator. No refund shall be
paid unless the claimant establishes a
right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto and makes a
claim filed within three (3) years of
the date of payment in the manner
and on forms prescribed and furnished by the Administrator, and stating under penalty of perjury, the specific grounds upon which the claim is
founded.

Section 193.07 Regulations for Filing Returns
(a) Each vendor or booking agent
collecting for a vendor shall on or
before the last day of the month make
and file a return for the preceding
month, on forms prescribed by the
Administrator, showing the receipts
from furnishing lodging, the amount
of tax due from the vendor or booking
agent collecting for a vendor to the
City for the period covered by the
return, and such other information as
the Administrator deems necessary
for the proper administration of this
chapter. All returns shall be signed by
the vendor, its authorized agent, or
booking agent collecting for a vendor. The Administrator may extend
the time for making and filing
returns. Returns shall be filed by
delivering or mailing the same to the
Administrator together with payment
of the full amount of tax shown to be
due thereon.
(b) The Administrator may authorize vendors or booking agents collecting for vendors whose tax liabilities are not such as to merit monthly
returns, as determined by the Administrator upon the basis of administrative costs of the City, to make and file
returns at less frequent intervals.
Such authorization shall be in writing
and shall indicate the intervals at
which returns are to be filed.
(c) Each vendor or booking agent
collecting for a vendor shall file all
claims for exemption from tax filed
by the transient guests with the vendor during the reporting period with
the return.
(d) The Administrator shall treat
all returns and payments submitted
by vendors and booking agents collecting for vendors as confidential
and shall not release them except

collect the transient occupancy tax or
to file a return or remit the tax or any
portion thereof, as required by this
chapter, and the vendor has not
received confirmation that a booking
agent has collected and remitted the
tax, the Administrator shall proceed
in such manner as he or she may deem
best to obtain information on which to
base an assessment of the tax due.
When the Administrator has obtained
such information as he or she is able,
he or she shall proceed to determine
and assess against such vendor the
tax and penalty provided for in this
chapter.
(b) In case such determination is
made, the Administrator shall serve
notice upon the vendor of the amount
so assessed, either by personal service or by registered or certified mail.
Such vendor may, within ten (10)
days after the serving or mailing of
such notice, apply in writing to the
Administrator for a hearing on the
correctness of that amount assessed.
If the vendor does not apply within
the time prescribed, the tax and
penalty determined by the Administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and
payable. If the vendor makes timely
application, the Administrator shall
give the vendor written notice not
less than five (5) days in advance in
the manner prescribed in this section,
to show cause at a time and place
fixed in the notice why the amount
specified therein should not be fixed
for such tax and penalty. At any such
hearing, the vendor may appear and
offer evidence why such specified tax
and penalty should not be so fixed.

June 15, 2016

Whereas, section 551.991 also authorizes the Director of Public Works to
issue a ticket for $350 to the responsible party if the quantity of solid

The City Record

June 15, 2016
Whereas, this Council has received
countless complaints from residents
who are being given $100 tickets for
violating section 551.111 even when
the quantity of waste set out is not
excessive under that code section;
and
Whereas, residents of the City pay
a fee of $8.75 per month for trash pickup; and
Whereas, this Council believes that
the number of tickets given for
alleged violations of section 551.111 is
excessive and that the process is not
well controlled; and
Whereas, this Council believes that
the ticketing for setting out excessive
waste must stop immediately so that
the Department of Public Works and
the Commissioner of Waste Collection
can better control the process in order
to issue tickets appropriately and
accurately; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an em ergenc y m easure for the

immediate preservation of the public
peace, property, health, safety, or
welfare in that a moratorium on the
issuance of tickets for infractions
related to setting out excessively large
quantities of waste for collection in
the City of Cleveland is necessary to
compel the Department of Public
Works to review and improve the
ticketing process; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, for the reasons stated in the preamble, this Council
declares
a
moratorium
on
the
issuance of $100 tickets for infractions related to setting out excessively large quantities of waste for collection in the City of Cleveland until
authorization is reestablished by
Council. This moratorium does not
extend to the issuance of tickets in
the amount of $350 for setting out
solid waste that exceeds ten (10)

39
approved waste containers, forty (40)
bags of yard waste, forty (40) bundles
of brush or tree trunks, eight (8) tires,
or six (6) special waste items.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately upon its passage and approval
by the Mayor; otherwise it shall take
effect and be in force from and after
the earliest period allowed by law.
Passed June 6, 2016.
Effective June 7, 2016.
