ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 751-18.
By Council Member McCormack.
An emergency resolution designating old Detroit Avenue between
West 24th Street and Center Street
as a residential permit parking area
for Stonebridge Tower residents.
Whereas, the Director of Public
Safety has received verified petitions by residents living in eighty
percent (80%) of the living units in
the area of old Detroit Avenue
between West 24th Street and Center Street; and
Whereas, the Director of Public
Safety has completed a survey of
the above mentioned street and the
surrounding areas, has held a public hearing, and has determined that
the number of off-street parking
spaces is inadequate to accommodate Stonebridge Tower residents’
vehicles, and widespread use of
available curbside parking spaces
by non-resident vehicles results in a
lack of nearby curbside parking;
and
Whereas, the Director of Public
Safety has therefore determined that
Old Detroit Avenue between West
24th Street and Center Street is eligible for residential permit parking
and has recommended to Council
that it designate said street as a residential permit parking area; and
Whereas, Council Member McCormack concurs in the Director’s recommendation; and
Whereas,
old
Detroit
Avenue
between West 24th Street and Center Street has otherwise met the
objective criteria set forth in Chapter 461 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland
Section 1. That this Council hereby designates old Detroit Avenue
between West 24th Street and Center Street a residential permit parking area, twenty-four (24) hours per
day, seven (7) days per week.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it received
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted September 24, 2018.
Effective September 26, 2018.

Res. No. 1162-18.
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Zone and Keane.
An emergency resolution declaring October 5, 2018 Energy Efficiency Day and urging residents to
support this City’s clean energy
goals and move toward more energy efficiency now and in the future.
Whereas, energy efficiency is the
art of getting the same or better
performance using less energy – all
while cutting utility bills for residential, business, and industrial customers; and

1657

19
Whereas, reliable, affordable energy is vital to our economic prosperity and energy efficiency is the
most productive and cost-effective
way to meet our energy needs; and
Whereas,
implementing
clean
energy policies and programs helps
boost economic opportunities and
job creation while continuing to
move toward a sustainable future;
and
Whereas, cutting energy waste
saves U.S. consumers billions of dollars on their utility bills annually,
up to $500 per household from appliance efficiency standards alone; and
Whereas, more than 2.2 million
Americans work in the energy efficiency sector in local, good-paying,
clean energy jobs that cannot be
outsourced; such jobs increase efficiency and will create more clean
energy jobs; and
Whereas,
smarter
energy
use
reduces the amount of electricity we
need to power our lives, which helps
avoid power plant emissions that
can harm our health, pollute our air,
and warm our climate; and
Whereas, residents of Cleveland
can contribute to this City’s sustainability efforts and energy efficiency efforts by learning more
about energy efficiency and practicing smarter energy use in their
daily lives, and by learning about
and participating in the Sustainable
Cleveland program; and
Whereas,
Cleveland
businesses
can contribute to the City’s sustainability efforts and energy efficiency
efforts by joining the Cleveland 2030
District and committing to reducing
energy use by the year 2030; and
Whereas, a nationwide network of
energy efficiency groups and partners has designated October 5th as
the national annual Energy Efficiency Day; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
declares October 5, 2018 Energy Efficiency Day and urges residents to
support this City’s clean energy
goals and move toward more energy efficiency now and in the future.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

20
Henninger Landfill site is an important component of a trail connection
between the Cleveland Metroparks
Zoo and the Towpath Trail through
the Old Brooklyn neighborhood as

Whereas,
the
State
of
Ohio,
through the Ohio Public Works Commission, administers financial assistance for the preservation of open
spaces, sensitive ecological areas
and stream corridors, through the
Clean Ohio Fund Green Space Conservation Program; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
recognizes the wishes to preserve
open space, and create opportunities
for passive recreation within the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, Western Reserve Land
Conservancy has previously successfully raised funds to acquire
and remediate the approximately 25
acres of land located in the City of
Cleveland, known as the Lower Big
Creek Project (the “Project”); and
Whereas, this Project will contribute to a network of protected
green space and public recreational
trails in the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the Western Reserve
Land Conservancy’s application to
the Ohio Public Works Commission,
or this Council’s support thereof,
does not commit the City of Cleveland to provide monetary support or
any other monetary or non-monetary
obligation in furtherance of the Project; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Western Reserve Land Conservancy’s Clean Ohio Fund Greenspace Conservation Program application to fund trail and park infrastructure installation at the former
Henninger Landfill as part of the
Lower Big Creek Project in the City
of Cleveland.
