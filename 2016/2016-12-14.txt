Ord. No. 1015-16.
By Council Member Kelley (by
initiative petition).
An ordinance to supplement the
Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland, 1976, by enacting a new
chapter relating to “Democracy Day”
and providing that the people of the
City
of
Cleveland
support
the
movement
to
amend
the
U.S.
Constitution
to
establish
that
corporations are not people and money
is not speech and also providing for
biennial public hearings on these
topics.
Whereas, free and fair elections are
essential to American democracy and
effective self-governance; and
Whereas, in a 2010 decision by the
U.S. Supreme Court, Citizens United v.
the Federal Election Commission, the
Supreme Court overturned some
provisions of the federal Campaign
Reform Act enacted in 2002, and ruled
that corporate entities, and labor
unions, have the same rights as
individuals to unrestricted spending
on political speech; and
Whereas, in reaching its decision, a
majority of the Supreme Court
interpreted the First Amendment of
the Constitution to afford corporations
the same free speech protection as
natural persons; and
Whereas, the Court’s decision in
effect allows unlimited corporate
spending to influence campaigns,
elections, lawmaking, and public
policy decisions; and
Whereas, the Court’s decision in
Citizens United severely restricts the
ability of federal, state, and local
governments to enact reasonable
campaign
finance
reforms
and
regulations
regarding
corporate
political activity; and
Whereas, the people of the United
States have previously used the
constitutional amendment process to
correct decisions of the U.S. Supreme
Court that are widely deemed to be
egregious or wrongly decided or

1910

December 14, 2016
significantly out-of-step with the
prevailing values of the populace; and
Whereas, the preservation and
protection of our democracy depend
upon the informed participation of the
citizens; and
Whereas, local governments have
an important role in protecting the
integrity of our political processes;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the People of the
City of Cleveland:
1.
That
the
Codified
Section
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976
are hereby supplemented by enacting
a new chapter to read as follows:
Democracy Day
Section 1. Beginning in the year
2017, the Mayor and City Council shall
designate one day in the second week
of May following the November
federal elections as “Democracy Day:
A Call for a U.S. Constitutional
Amendment.” On this day, the Mayor
and City Council shall sponsor a
Public Hearing in a public space
within the City. The City shall
publicize the Public Hearing on its
website and through area media at
least one (1) month in advance of the
Hearing. The Public Hearing will
examine the impact on the City of
political contributions of corporations,
unions, Political Action Committees,
and Super-PACS. The Mayor and at
least one (1) City Councilperson shall
submit testimony at the public
hearing. In addition, all citizens of
Cleveland will be permitted to submit
oral testimony for a period of at least
five (5) minutes per citizen. The
public hearing shall be held during an
evening or weekend time. The City
shall record the minutes of the hearing
and make them available to the public
no later than three months after the
Hearing by posting them on the City’s
website.
Section 2. Within one (1) week
following the Public Hearing, the
Mayor shall send a letter to the leaders
of the Ohio House and Senate, and
Cleveland’s
U.S.
Congressional
Representatives, and both Ohio U.S.
Senators stating that the citizens of
Cleveland in November 2016 voted in
support of a Citizen’s Initiative
calling for an amendment to the U.S.
Constitution declaring:
A)
Only
human
beings,
not
corporations, are legal persons with
Constitutional rights;
B) Money is not equivalent to
speech, and, therefore, regulating
political contributions and spending is
not equivalent to limiting political
speech.
Section 3. The biennial Public
Hearings will continue for a period of
ten (10) years through May 2027 or
until a constitutional amendment
reflecting the principles set forth in
Section 2 is ratified by three-quarters
(3/4) of state legislatures.
Section 4. This initiative shall take
effect and be included in the City
Ordinances at the earliest date
permitted under Chapter V, Section 36
of the City of Cleveland Codified
Ordinances.
Section 2. That this ordinance shall
take effect and be in force from and
after the earliest period allowed by
law.
Passed December 5, 2016.

Zone Agreement with HEC Properties, LLC, or its designee, to provide
for tax abatement for certain real
property improvements at 2700 East

Enterprise Zone.
Whereas, by letter dated October

Whereas, the Enterprise has certified to the City that it would be
at a competitive disadvantage operating at this location if taxes on certain real property improvements
were not abated; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, safety, property, and welfare and that its enactment is a necessary prerequisite to
providing immediate assistance to
create and preserve job opportunities and advance and promote commercial and economic development

Workforce Investment Board for
Workforce Area No. 3 to identify and
solicit qualified candidates for job
opportunities related to the City’s

are disabled and people who have
been convicted of or who have pled
guilty to a criminal offense which is
unrelated to the duties of the job
opportunity.
Section 7. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure

Midwest Development Partners
The Midwest Development Partners LLC collaboration is a partnership of two Cleveland families, who invest, develop, own and manage real estate, both in Northeast Ohio and nationwide. The Goldberg/Ponsky and the Weiss families’
shared experiences have resulted in a professional and personal relationship spanning over three generations. Midwest
Development Partners LLC was formed to pursue these development opportunities and to function as the development
arm of the long standing relationships.
Project Description
Midwest Development Partners (principals Steve Rubin, Zac Ponsky and Elie Weiss) are proposing, Centric, an
approximately $78 million market rate mixed-use retail and residential apartment building with associated parking
garage. The project is located in University Circle at the intersection of Mayfield Road and a new extension of Circle
Drive. The site is located west of the Little Italy neighborhood, southeast of Uptown, and is immediately adjacent to
Abington Arms Apartments and the Cleveland Institute of Art. Centric is the latest version of the original Intesa project
started in 2012.
The existing site consists of a parking lot, known as Lot #45, and an existing street (E. 117th St.), which will be vacated. The proposed seven-story mixed-use building will have 28,000 SF of ground floor of retail space and residential lobbies. The upper six floors will contain 269 unique apartments and residential amenity spaces. The building will be designated to meet LEED silver certification. The six-story concrete garage will provide 360 parking spaces for residential
and public use. The total development cost for the project is approximately $78 million.
Proposed City Assistance:
The Developer has approached the City to help finance a portion of this project in the form of a TIF. Escalated construction costs including $10 million for the structured parking garage and $5.2 million in public infrastructure and roadway realignment are contributing to the project financing gap. Parking continues to be a challenge in the University
Circle neighborhood and the funding of this public portion of the project will assist with the neighborhood’s growing
need.
The costs associated with these public improvements exceed the value of the TIF proceeds. The TIF proceeds will be
used for repayment of eligible project debt related to these improvements. The Centric Team is working with other public funding sources to assist with the financing gap including a $360,000 grant from NEORSD, along with $900,000 in savings from the Port Authority’s Capital lease structure for tax exempt material. The TIF proceeds are the last public sector commitment needed to cover the gap and allow the project to go forward.
Construction is intended to begin in 2016 and to be completed by fall of 2017. The Developer has agreed to a Community Benefits Agreement which will include interns from Max Hayes High school. Substantial new taxes will also be
generated from operations of the property and its retail, management and residential occupants, including sales, sin,
commercial activities and income taxes from the projected 400 apartment residents and 75 permanent employees of the
project.
Economic Impact:
• Project anticipates 400 new residents
• Project estimates creation of at least 75 full-time permanent jobs
• Estimated $160,826 in anticipated Annual Income tax revenues to the City of Cleveland from residents and new jobs
• Redevelopment of currently vacant held, City owned property
• Project estimates $450,000 in property taxes for the School District annually
• Project estimates $184,413 in parking, income, and residence taxes annually
• Over the 30-year term of the TIF, the project estimates $13.5 Million in property taxes for the School District and $5.5
million in parking, income, and residence taxes for the City.
City Requirements:
• Loan is subject to the Fair Employment Law
• Loan is subject to the Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland Resident Employment Law
• Loan is subject to MBE/FBE/CSB
• Project will have a Workforce Development Agreement
Section 3. That, under Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code, Redeveloper (or the owners of the Improvements) shall
make service payments for a period of thirty years in lieu of the exempt taxes to the Cuyahoga County Treasurer; the
payments shall be charged and collected in the same manner, and shall be in an amount not less than the taxes that
would have been paid had the Improvements not been exempt from taxation.
Section 4. That a portion of the service payments collected under this ordinance shall be distributed by the Cuyahoga
County Treasurer to the Treasurer of the District in the amount of the taxes that would have been payable to the District had the Improvement not been exempt from taxation.
Section 5. That the Director of Economic Development is authorized to enter into an agreement or agreements with
Redeveloper to provide for the exemption and service payments described in this ordinance, including agreements securing the payments described in this ordinance, which agreement or agreements shall contain those terms contained in
this ordinance.
Section 6. That under Section 5709.43 of the Revised Code, there is established an identified Urban Redevelopment Tax
Increment Equivalent Fund into which shall be deposited service Payments in Lieu of Taxes (“PILOTS”) which shall be
used for the purposes described in this ordinance, or File, or for other economic development purposes as determined by
the Director of Economic Development.
Section 7. That it is found and determined that all formal actions of this Council concerning and relating to the passage of this ordinance were adopted in open meetings of this Council, and any of its committees that resulted in formal
action were in meetings open to the public in compliance with the law.
Section 8. That this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the affirmative vote
of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take effect and be in force immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.

Project Summary
The Dalad Group (“Dalad”) is proposing the Worthington Yards project, a renovation of five, 100-year old buildings at
725 Johnson Court in Downtown Cleveland. Dalad will convert the buildings into 98 market rate loft apartments with
heated indoor parking, a fitness center, and a restaurant space. Dalad also intends to develop two enclosed open areas
into courtyards, one private and one public. These spaces will distinguish Worthington Yards as the only downtown residential property with captive green space and 47 of the apartments will either have their own balcony or patio. The five
story project will occupy approximately 180,000 square feet when complete. There will be an estimated 63 one bedroom,
33 two bedroom, and 2 three bedroom apartments.
Dalad Group is a full service real estate company based in Independence, Ohio. Founded in 1947, Dalad has been an
innovative developer of office, industrial and retail space throughout the region. Dalad has completed numerous historic
renovation projects within the City of Cleveland, including the Hoyt Block featuring the Blue Point Restaurant, the Hat
Factory apartments on West 6th Street, 2320 Lofts located at 2320 Superior (serving CSU students) and the Creswell
Building at 1220 Huron Road. Dalad also has a local portfolio of nearly two and a half million square feet of commercial
real estate.
Proposed City Assistance:
The request to Cleveland City Council is to authorize the Director of Economic Development to enter into a non-school
Tax Increment Finance (TIF) agreement with Worthington Yards Ltd or its designee. These TIF funds will be used for
project debt associated with Worthington Yards. This TIF agreement will be up to 30 years in length. The City will
declare certain improvements with respect to the project to be a public purpose and exempt 100% of the improvements
from real property taxes.
Under the agreement, parcels acquired and re-conveyed to the developer will be “TIFed” under section 5709.41 of the
Ohio Revised Code in consideration for the developer agreeing to make certain improvements to those parcels, and
agreeing to make payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT) equal to the taxes that would have been paid for those parcels but
for the TIF. A portion of the PILOT will be paid to the Cleveland Municipal School District by the Cuyahoga County Fiscal Officer in the amount the District would have otherwise received but for the TIF. The Borrower will be responsible
for any shortfall of PILOT payments for project costs.
This piece of legislation will complete the legislation required to enter into the TIF Agreement with the Developer.
