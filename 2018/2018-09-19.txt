FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 1162-18.
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Zone and Keane.
An emergency resolution declaring October 5, 2018 Energy Efficiency Day and urging residents to
support this City’s clean energy
goals and move toward more energy efficiency now and in the future.
Whereas, energy efficiency is the
art of getting the same or better
performance using less energy – all
while cutting utility bills for residential, business, and industrial customers; and
Whereas, reliable, affordable energy is vital to our economic prosperity and energy efficiency is the
most productive and cost-effective
way to meet our energy needs; and
Whereas,
implementing
clean
energy policies and programs helps
boost economic opportunities and
job creation while continuing to
move toward a sustainable future;
and
Whereas, cutting energy waste
saves U.S. consumers billions of dollars on their utility bills annually,
up to $500 per household from appliance efficiency standards alone; and
Whereas, more than 2.2 million
Americans work in the energy efficiency sector in local, good-paying,
clean energy jobs that cannot be
outsourced; such jobs increase efficiency and will create more clean
energy jobs; and
Whereas,
smarter
energy
use
reduces the amount of electricity we
need to power our lives, which helps
avoid power plant emissions that
can harm our health, pollute our air,
and warm our climate; and
Whereas, residents of Cleveland
can contribute to this City’s sustainability efforts and energy efficiency efforts by learning more
about energy efficiency and practicing smarter energy use in their
daily lives, and by learning about
and participating in the Sustainable
Cleveland program; and
Whereas,
Cleveland
businesses
can contribute to the City’s sustainability efforts and energy efficiency
efforts by joining the Cleveland 2030
District and committing to reducing
energy use by the year 2030; and

1580

September 19, 2018
Whereas, a nationwide network of
energy efficiency groups and partners has designated October 5th as
the national annual Energy Efficiency Day; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
declares October 5, 2018 Energy Efficiency Day and urges residents to
support this City’s clean energy
goals and move toward more energy efficiency now and in the future.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Inc., DBA Drink Bar, 4005-07 East
131st Street and patio, Cleveland,
Ohio 44105, Permit Number 2759855;
and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is

The City Record
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or

Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
