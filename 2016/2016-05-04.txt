An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 457.10 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
enacted by Ordinance No. 522-08,
passed June 9, 2008, relating to bicycle parking.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 457.10 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, as enacted by Ordinance
No. 522-08, passed June 9, 2008, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 457.10 Bicycle Parking
As a condition of the issuance or
renewal of an annual license, all
parking lots and garages subject to
the provisions of this chapter shall
provide spaces for bicycle parking in
accordance with the following regulations.
(a) Purpose. The requirements for
bicycle parking are established for
the purpose of ensuring adequate and
safe facilities to accommodate bicycle
parking and to encourage use of bicycles for travel as an alternative to use
of motorized vehicles.
(b) Time of Compliance. For applicable parking lots and garages that
were licensed prior to the initial effective date of this section, required bicycle parking spaces shall be provided
no later than two (2) years after the
initial effective date of this section.
For other applicable parking lots and
garages, required bicycle parking
spaces shall be provided prior to the
issuance of a license.
(c) Number of Bicycle Parking
Spaces. Bicycle parking spaces shall
be provided at a rate of one (1) bicycle parking space for each twenty
(20) automobile spaces provided.
However, no automobile parking lot
or garage shall be required to provide
more than twenty-four (24) bicycle
parking spaces.
(d) Substitution for Automobile
Spaces. The total number of automobile
off-street
parking
spaces
required under the Zoning Code shall
be reduced at the ratio of one (1) automobile off-street parking space for
each six (6) bicycle spaces provided.
The total number of required automobile off-street parking spaces, however, shall not be reduced by more than
five percent (5%) for any parking lot
or garage.

May 4, 2016
(e) Bicycle Parking Space Size.
Required bicycle parking spaces for
nonresidential uses must have minimum dimensions of two (2) feet in
width by six (6) feet in length.
(f) Bicycle Parking Space Location. Required bicycle parking spaces
shall be located at least as close to the
entrance of the building as the nearest non- handicapped automobile
parking space. Where automobile
parking is provided in an enclosed
area, bicycle parking shall be provided within the enclosure or in such a
way as to provide comparable protection from the elements.
(g) Bicycle Racks and Lockers.
Each required bicycle parking space
shall be equipped with a bicycle rack
or “bicycle locker,” as defined in this
section.
(1) Design. Bicycle racks and lockers must be securely anchored to the
ground or a building. Bicycle racks
must provide a stable frame to which
the bicycle may be conveniently
secured, such as the inverted-U, post
and loop, or another type of rack that
meets these standards. Bicycle racks
that support the wheel but not the
frame of the bike may not be used to
fulfill a bicycle parking requirement.
In parking lots and parking garages,
physical barriers, such as posts or bollards, shall be provided so as to prevent a motor vehicle from striking a
parked bicycle.
(2) Residential Uses. Neither bicycle racks nor bicycle lockers are
required for bicycle parking associated with residential uses. Required
bicycle parking for residential uses
may be provided in garages, storage
rooms, or any other resident-accessible, secure areas.
(h) Bike Locker. As used in this section, “bike locker” means a locker or
storage space large enough to house a
single bicycle and which may be
secured and accessed by a single user.
(i) Alternate Locations and Number
of Spaces. For public parking garages
and parking lots legally established
prior to June 9, 2008, the Director of
the City Planning Commission may
approve locations other than the
garage or lot for the required bicycle
parking spaces or less than the
required number of bicycle parking
spaces if the Director determines
that, under the following circumstances, alternate locations or number of bicycle parking spaces would
better meet the stated purpose of this
Section:
(1) A single entity controls multiple parking garages or parking lots
that serve the same business or use;
(2) The aggregate number of bicycle parking spaces for the multiple
parking garages or parking lots that
serve the same business or use will
meet or exceed the bicycle parking
requirements under this Section;
(3) A location on another property
or in the public right-of-way represents the only feasible means to meet
the requirement for bicycle parking
spaces. A location in the public rightof-way shall be permitted only if such
location meets all requirements for
issuance of an Encroachment Permit.
Section 2. That Section 457.10 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, as enacted by Ordinance
No. 522-08, passed June 9, 2008, is
repealed.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take

upon its passage and approval by the

professional services necessary to
provide
emergency
assessment,
inspection, and testing of the Willow

Lift Bridge, including the sheave
trunnion bearings and other components and engineering and design of
the replacement of bearings; one or
more standard purchase or requirement contracts with The Timken Corporation for the manufacture of one
or more bridge bearings; and authorizing written standard or requirement contracts for labor and materials for the installation of any bearings.
Whereas, in December 2015, one of
the counterweight sheave trunnion
bearings (“Bearings”) of the Willow
Lift Bridge was found to be in a state
of progressive failure and an emergency restraint system was installed
to allow the bridge to resume safe
operations on a limited basis; and
Whereas, TranSystems Corporation
of Ohio, a consultant operating under
the Office of Capital Projects’ general
engineering service contract authority,
partially
disassembled
and
inspected the northwest Bearings,
and performed vibration and lubricant testing; and
Whereas, the test results and an
April 20, 2016 inspection determined
that the bridge may remain operational if limited to four lifts per day
until the northwest Bearings are
replaced or repaired but that additional inspection, assessment, and
testing of the bridge is needed immediately to determine if the remaining
Bearings are in a similar state of progressive failure and present a danger
to the public health, safety or welfare;
and
Whereas, The Timken Corporation
is the sole-source manufacturer of the
Bearings; and
Whereas, it is necessary to provide
emergency assessment, inspection,
and testing of the other Willow Lift
Bridge Bearings and other components to determine if other labor and
materials are necessary for the
bridge to resume safe and normal
operation; and
Whereas, the Director of Capital
Projects has determined, that based
upon TranSystems Corporation of
Ohio’s knowledge of the bridge’s construction,
experience,
immediate
availability, quality, and cost, to
ensure safe operation, the City should
engage it to perform the additional
professional services needed for
emergency assessment, inspection,
and testing of the Willow Lift Bridge;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of Capital Projects is authorized to enter into
a contract with TranSystems Corporation of Ohio (“Consultant”) for the
professional services necessary to
provide an emergency assessment,
inspection, and testing of the Willow
Lift Bridge, including its Bearings
and other components, to determine
what labor and materials, if any, are
necessary to restore the bridge to safe
and normal operating condition, and
to perform the engineering and
design necessary to facilitate the
replacement of the northwest Bearings, in accordance with its April 20,
2016 proposal.
Except for Stafford
Bandlow Engineering, Inc. and SKF
USA, Inc., the Consultant shall not
sublet or subcontract performance of
any work or services or provision of

The City Record

10
any supplies or materials without the
previous written consent of the Board
of Control.
Section 2. That this Council determines that the necessary Bearings
are non-competitive and urgently
required and cannot be secured from
any source other than The Timken
Corporation (“Contractor”).
Therefore, the Director of Capital Projects
is authorized to make one or more
written standard purchase or requirement contracts with the Contractor,
for the requirements for a period not
to exceed one year, with one option to
renew for an additional year, exercisable by the Director of Capital Projects, of the necessary items of the
manufacture of Willow Lift Bridge
Bearings, at a cost of $309,499.70 for
the northwest Bearings and housings
and a cost based upon a quote from
the Contractor for any additional
Bearings, to be purchased by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
on a unit basis, for the Office of Capital Projects. Because the Contractor
requires a minimum of 26 weeks to
manufacture the northwest or other
Bearings, to preclude or minimize a
potential interruption of public service, an immediate purchase is
required. Therefore, the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies is authorized to issue one or more delivery
orders, for manufacture of one or
more Bearings required for the safe
operation of the bridge, notwithstanding that a contract with the Contrac-

tor may not have been executed. The
Contractor shall not sublet or subcontract performance of any work or provision of any supplies or materials
without the previous written consent
of the Board of Control.
Section 3. That, if necessary to prevent an interruption of public service
or a danger to the public health, safety or welfare, the Director of Capital
Projects is authorized to make one or
more written standard purchase contracts or requirement contracts,
notwithstanding any provision of the
Charter and the Codified Ordinances
of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, for a period
not exceeding one year, with one
option to renew for an additional
year, exercisable by the director, for
the necessary items of the labor and
materials for the installation of the
northwest and any other Bearings or
other related items determined to be
needed to restore the bridge to safe
and normal operating condition, to be
purchased by the Commissioner of
Purchases and Supplies on a unit
basis for the Office of Capital Projects affording as much competition
as is practical under the circumstances. Bids, quotes, or proposals, as
appropriate, shall be taken in a manner that permits an award to be made
for all items as a single contract, or by
separate contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board of
Control determines. The contractor
shall not sublet or subcontract performance of any work or provision of
any supplies or materials without the

May 4, 2016
previous written consent of the Board
of Control in accordance with Section
181.37 of the codified ordinances
Section 4. That the costs of the
requirement contract or contracts
shall be paid from Fund Nos. 20 SF
520, 20 SF 528, 20 SF 534, 20 SF 540, 20
FS 546, 20 SF 554, 20 SF 563, 20 SF 568,
or may be charged against the proper

Director of Finance shall certify the
amount of any purchase under the
contract, each of which purchases
shall be made on order of the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies by a
delivery order issued against the contract or contracts and certified by the
Director of Finance.

(by

An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Sections 490.01, 490.02, 490.03, and
490.99, relating to unmanned aircraft
systems.
Whereas,
the
operation
of
unmanned aircraft systems (“UAS”)
has recently increased significantly
both locally and nationally and
numerous incidents have occurred
involving UAS operations in restricted areas without compliance with
existing Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) regulatory guidance;
and
Whereas, there is currently no legislation that regulates UAS operations in the City of Cleveland or provides specific enforcement authority
to safety officers; and
Whereas, this situation poses a significant
enforcement
issue
for
responding officers; and
Whereas, the United States Government has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States under 49
U.S.C. §40103; and
Whereas, the FAA has issued Law
Enforcement Guidance For Suspected
Unauthorized UAS Operations, stating that local law enforcement agencies are often in the best position to
deter, detect, immediately investigate, and pursue enforcement actions
to stop unauthorized UAS; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
supplemented by adding new Sections
490.01, 490.02, 490.03, and 490.99, to

means an Unmanned Aircraft and its
associated elements (including communication links and the components
that control the Unmanned Aircraft)
that are required for the safe and efficient operation of the Unmanned Aircraft in the National Airspace System.
Section 490.02 Purpose and Intent
This Chapter is intended to promote
public safety. In consideration of this
concern, the City is restricting the use
of UAS in certain areas. It is not
intended to restrict legitimate hobbyists operating unmanned aircraft systems in compliance with FAA rules
and regulations. This Chapter is not
intended to preempt FAA rules and
regulations, but to operate in conjunction with those rules to promote public safety while recognizing the limitations in the FAA’s enforcement
capabilities.
Section 490.03 Restrictions
(a) Anyone who launches, operates,
or causes to be launched or operated,
any Unmanned Aircraft System within the limits of Cleveland, Ohio, must
be able to present, immediately upon
request by any member of the Police
or Fire Force, a current Certificate of
Aircraft Registration issued by the
Federal Aviation Administration for
the Unmanned Aircraft System.
(b) No person shall launch, operate,
or cause to be launched or operated,
any Unmanned Aircraft System in
any airspace within or over:
(1) A five (5) mile radius of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport;
(2) A five (5) mile radius of Burke
Lakefront Airport; or
(3) Any area of the City of Cleveland that the Federal Aviation
Administration determines to be a
restricted area, either by way of a
Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), Temporary Flight Restriction, No Drone
Zone, or other means.
(c) Division (b) of this section shall
not apply to any person who has previous approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to operate a
UAS in a restricted area and is complying with all terms and conditions
of their approval.
Section 490.99 Violation; Penalties
Whoever violates division (a) of
Section 490.03 of this chapter is guilty
of a minor misdemeanor. Whoever
violates division (b) of Section 490.03
of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree on the
first offense, a misdemeanor of the
third degree on the second offense,
and a misdemeanor of the second
degree on the third and any subsequent offense. All violations will be
forwarded to the Federal Aviation
Administration and reviewed for possible violations of Federal civil and
criminal statutes. The Department of
Public Safety will enforce and ensure
compliance with the provisions of this
Chapter.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by the
