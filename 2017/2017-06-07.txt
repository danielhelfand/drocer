ordinance
authorizing the Director of Economic
Development

providing immediate assistance to
create and preserve job opportunities and advance and promote commercial and economic development

or jobs will be lost; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

to

Company Background
The applicant for this proposed HUD 108 loan will be Hemingway Development LLC and/or designee (“Developer”). The
Developer has spent the past several years redeveloping formerly vacant and underutilized sites in the Health-Tech
Corridor of the MidTown neighborhood in Cleveland, including the development of three buildings at MidTown Tech
Park and the Agora Building. The principals of Hemingway Development LLC are Fred Geis, James Doyle, and Michael
Panzica.
Project Summary
Tax Increment Financing will support the development of a new 60,000 SF grocery store located at the intersection of
E. 63rd and Chester for Dave’s Supermarkets. Dave’s Supermarkets is a family-owned and operated supermarket chain
founded in the City of Cleveland in 1932. The site is currently a vacant lot that was formerly the Hattenbach building. The
proposed one-story building will include approximately 50,000 square feet for the grocery store and approximately 10,000
square feet of mezzanine space for a pharmacy, bank, and neighborhood gathering space. The total development cost for
the project is approximately $16.6 million. City financing is required in order to lower the cost of occupancy to ensure the
project’s long-term success. The project has also applied for and received a pre-commitment for approximately $4M
allocation of New Market Tax Credits (NMTC).
This new construction supermarket will be part of Hemingway Development’s Link59 campus and will be located across
the street from University Hospitals’ new Rainbow Center for Women and Children, an ambulatory care center. Directly
on the HealthLine, the grocery store will provide residents access to fresh, healthy and affordable food. Utilizing a grant
from US Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), local residents that are patients of the Rainbow Center will
receive healthy food “prescriptions” from physicians and other care providers for redemption at the supermarket. The
HHS grant will also allow the supermarket to provide cooking classes and seminars to create awareness around the
benefits of healthy food choices and nutritional education. WIC, SNAP and other subsidies will be accepted in order to
make the purchase of healthy food choices affordable.
Proposed City Assistance
• This ordinance will authorize the Director of Economic Development to enter into a 30-year non-school Tax Increment
Finance (TIF) agreement with Hemingway Development or its designee. The City will declare certain improvements
with respect to the project to be a public purpose and exempt 100% of the improvements from real property taxes. The
TIF proceeds will be on all non-abated, non-school portion of real estate taxes for the first 10 years and will capture
all non-school real estate taxes in the remaining 20 years.

• The developer agrees to make certain improvements to those parcels and make payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTs)
equal to the taxes that would have been paid for those parcels but for the TIF. A portion of the PILOTs will be paid
to the Cleveland Municipal School District in the amount the District would have otherwise received but for the TIF.
The balance of the PILOTs will be utilized to fund eligible project costs and project debt. The Developer will be
responsible for any shortfall of PILOT payments for project costs.
Economic Impact
• Project estimates the retention of 115 full time equivalent jobs in the City of Cleveland, with an annual payroll of
$3,850,000
• Estimated $96,250 annual income tax revenue from retained jobs
• Development of currently vacant land on the Euclid Corridor
• Promotion of access to fresh, healthy and affordable food in a transit-oriented development

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS REFERRED
Res. No. 728-17.
By Council Member Kelley (by
departmental request).
An emergency resolution to adopt
and declare a Tax Budget for the
City of Cleveland for the year 2018
and submit it to the County Budget
Commission as required by State
Law, Chapter 5705 of the Revised
Code.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council, under
the provisions of Chapter 5705 of the
Revised Code, after public hearings
as required by law, does adopt the
statements of the year 2018 requirements for the several funds of the
City of Cleveland as being the budget required by state law to be submitted to the County Budget Commission, which requirements are
contained in File No. 728-17-A.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to certify a copy of the
resolution to the County Auditor of
Cuyahoga County.

declared to be an emergency measure
and,
provided
it
receives
the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all

Res. No. 745-17.
By Council Members Conwell and
Zone.
An emergency resolution supporting and urging Mayor Jackson’s
Administration to continue developing a Public Safety Department policy and training program to help
police officers communicate and
interact effectively with people who
are deaf or hard of hearing.
Whereas, incidents of police violence toward people with disabilities
and people who are deaf in particular are becoming all too common,
according to experts; and
Whereas, the Ruderman Family
Foundation released a report in
March 2016, stating that “disability
is the missing word in media coverage of police violence, and that
disabled persons make up a third to
half of all people killed by law
enforcement officers”; and
Whereas, all law enforcement officers need to understand that people
who are deaf or hard of hearing
communicate in ways that are different from most officers’ way of
communicating; and
Whereas, individuals who are deaf
or hard of hearing may rely on
American Sign Language, lip reading or, in some circumstances, communicating with a pen or paper; in
some cases communication access is
mandated by federal and state civil
rights laws, and law enforcement
officers have to be prepared to provide such access whenever possible,
especially in life and death situations; and

Whereas, law enforcement officers
too often make verbal orders for
individuals
to
comply
and
act
aggressively when those individuals
do not comply, and deaf individuals
often are unable to understand verbal commands of law enforcement
officers, which has led to many
physical altercations between law
enforcement officers and deaf individuals over the years, with some
resulting in death; and
Whereas, local human resource
and
police
department
leaders
should strongly consider creative
ways to address the needs and concerns from the police officer’s perspective such as maintaining the
peace and security and protecting
themselves, while still respecting
the rights of citizens who are deaf
or hard of hearing; and
Whereas, Cleveland’s Public Safety Department should train the
police academy and police officers
to comply with the Americans with
Disabilities Act Guide for Law
Enforcement
Officers,
including
“Communicating with People Who
are Deaf or Hard of Hearing” and
“Practical Suggestions for Communicating Effectively”; and
Whereas, Cleveland police officers
should be trained to use a variety
of auxiliary aids to communicate
effectively with deaf and/or hearing
impaired persons, such as gestures,
visual aids, a note pad and pen or
pencil, a computer, an assistive listening device, a teletypewriter, and
a qualified oral or language interpreter; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the current methods used by Cleveland’s Public Safety Department for
handling
calls
from
hearing
impaired citizens, including 1) text
telephones (TTY), 2) seven-digit
TTY telephone number for citizens
to reach a call taker station, 3) Ohio
relay service that acts as an intermediary for TTY callers, 4) text to
9-1-1 scheduled to go live in July
2017 that will allow citizens to use
standard cell phone test messaging
to contact 9-1-1, and 5) iPads with
live video American Sign Language
Interpreters available through an
app called Z5 in each District, and
encourages further public safety
policies and training to help police
officers
effectively
communicate
with people who are deaf or hard of
hearing.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports and urges Mayor Jackson’s
Administration to continue developing a Public Safety Department policy and training program to help
police officers communicate and
interact effectively with people who
are deaf or hard of hearing.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to Mayor Frank G. Jackson,
Tim Hennessy, Assistant Director of
Public
Safety,
Debra
Cavett,
Commander,
and
Maria
O’Neil
Ruddock, Community Center for the
Deaf and Hard of Hearing.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all

1024

June 7, 2017
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force

infractions related to setting out

32
An emergency resolution joining
Mayor Jackson in reaffirming the
City’s commitment to taking action
to reduce climate pollution and in
reaffirming the City’s continued support of the principles of the Paris
Climate Accord; and supporting the
Mayor in his decision to join Climate Mayors in defense of a worldwide climate action plan.
Whereas, this City desires to protect and enhance quality of life for
all those who live, work, learn and
play in our community, as well as
for our children and grandchildren;
and
Whereas, there is scientific consensus regarding the reality of climate change and the recognition
that human activity, especially the
combustion of fossil fuels that create greenhouse gases, is an important driver of climate change; and
Whereas, climate change has been
widely recognized by government,
business and academic leaders as a
worldwide threat with the potential
to harm our economy, safety, public
health, and quality of life; and
Whereas, members of our community and others are already feeling
the
effects
of
climate
change
through
increased
temperatures,
more extreme weather events, and
other disruptions that affect our residents, economy, and way of life;
and
Whereas, many local, regional,
and global economies are in the
process of prioritizing efficiency
and
transitioning
to
low-carbon
energy sources; and
Whereas, actions that reduce climate pollution also have potential to
improve air quality, public health,
energy security, our local natural
environment, and quality of life for
our residents; and
Whereas, taking steps to increase
efficiency and resilience can attract
jobs
and
economic
development
opportunities to our community and
increase our long-term economic
competitiveness and wealth; and
Whereas, Cleveland has demonstrated
a
legacy
of
leadership
against
the
threat
of
climate
change, for example:
• in 2013, the City worked with 50
organizations
to
create
the
Cleveland Climate Action Plan
which includes a goal of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions 80% by
2050;
• the City signed onto the Global
Covenant of Mayors for Climate
and Energy, and has annually
reported our citywide emissions
to the Carbon Disclosure Project;
• the Funders' Network for Smart
Growth and Livable Communities
has recently awarded Cleveland a
grant to update its Climate
Action Plan;
• in
2015-2016
the
Cleveland
Climate Action Fund supported
25 resident-led, neighborhoodbased projects;
• the Cleveland Energy Saver
program which complements the
existing weatherization program
provided more than 150 home
energy retrofits;
• Cleveland received a $40 million
grant from the U.S. Department of
Energy to complete the first
freshwater offshore wind project
in North America;
• Cleveland Public Power is on
track to have 25% of its
electricity come from renewable
sources by 2025;

The City Record
• between 2014-2016, 46 miles of
new bike infrastructure has been
installed throughout the City;
• the City launched the Cleveland
Tree Plan, which has a goal of
50,000 new trees by 2020 and an
increased canopy from 19% to
30% by 2040;
• the City distributed more than
4,000 rain barrels to Cleveland
residents through the Mayor’s
Summer
Youth
Employment
Program; and
Whereas, we are joined in taking
action on climate change by a global coalition of cities, state and
national governments and community and private sector leaders who
recognize the importance and potential of these actions to protect and
enhance the well-being of current
and future generations; and
Whereas, more than two hundred
(200)
mayors
representing
more
than 50 million Americans have
recently
re-affirmed
their
cities’
commitments to climate action; and
Whereas, Cleveland actively collaborates with other local governments throughout our region, state,
nation, and the world to learn from
each other and identify win-win
opportunities to take action on climate change while creating measurable benefits in our communities;
and
Whereas, 195 countries, including
the United States, vowed to address
climate
change
in
agreements
reached in Paris in December 2015
(the “Paris Climate Accord”); and
Whereas, on June 1, 2017, the
President
withdrew
the
United
States from the Accord, saying it is
disadvantageous to the U.S.; and
Whereas, the reality of climate
change has not been affected by
recent political announcements; and
Whereas, although the federal
government refuses to commit to
working with the rest of the world
to combat global climate change,
the Mayor and this Council will continue to stand with cities and other
public and private sector partners
throughout the world to advance
action in accordance with the goals
outlined in the Paris Accord; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council joins
Mayor Jackson in reaffirming the
City’s commitment to taking action
to reduce climate pollution and in
reaffirming the City’s continued support of the principles of the Paris
Climate Accord; and supports the
Mayor in his decision to join Climate Mayors in defense of a worldwide climate action plan.

is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to the President of the

legislature; the Climate Mayors; the
