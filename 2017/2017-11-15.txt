Section 2. Determinations by Council. This Council finds and determines as follows:
(a) Public Purpose. The acquisition, financing and refinancing by
the City of the Cleveland Stadium
pursuant to the Ground Lease, the
Facility Lease and the Trust Agreement and the use of the Cleveland
Stadium as a source of public relaxation and entertainment served and
serves a proper public municipal
purpose.
(b)Supplemental
Ground
Lease,
Supplemental Lease, Supplemental
Trust Agreement and Refunding
Certificates. It is necessary, proper
and in the best interest of the City
to authorize one or more Supplemental Ground Leases, Supplemental Leases and Purchase Agreements and approve one or more Supplemental Trust Agreements and the
issuance of Refunding Certificates
in one or more series for the purpose of refunding one or more series
of the Outstanding Certificates or
designated portions thereof, (i) to
obtain aggregate net present value
savings in Certificate Payments and
corresponding Base Rent payments
of at least three percent (3%), (ii)
to avoid or mitigate undesirably
high rates of interest or undesirable
fluctuations in rates of interest in
Certificate
Payments
and
corresponding Base Rent payments of
Outstanding Certificates that are
short-term or variable-rate obligations, or risks or expenses associated with hedging arrangements or
credit support instruments of those
short-term or variable-rate obligations, or (iii) to eliminate or modify covenants that are unduly restrictive, or to obtain a more favorable
Base Rent payment schedule or
more favorable terms under credit
support instruments.
Separate series of Refunding Certificates may be issued at the same
or
different
times.
A
Purchase
Agreement, Supplemental Lease and
Supplemental Trust Agreement shall
be delivered for each series and may
be delivered for multiple series. A
Supplemental Ground Lease shall be
delivered for any series of Refunding Certificates with a final maturity later than the final maturity of
the then Outstanding Certificates.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Refunding
Certificates and signing and delivery of Supplemental Ground Leases,
Supplemental Leases and Purchase
Agreements and approval of Supplemental Trust Agreements in connection with such issuance for the
purpose provided in this Ordinance
serves a proper, public, municipal
purpose by reducing or stabilizing
or minimizing risks of increasing
the costs to the City of the leasepurchase of the Cleveland Stadium,
which is a source of public relaxation and entertainment for the people of the City of Cleveland.
Section 3. Authorization of Hedging
Arrangements.
This
Council
finds that by engaging in interest
rate hedging arrangements with

November 15, 2017
respect to the Facility Lease and
Certificates the City may reduce its
financing costs by optimizing the
relative amounts of fixed and variable rate obligations, or minimizing
the risk of variations in its financing costs, or minimizing any risks,
burdens or costs associated with
existing hedging arrangements, or
obtaining savings by confirming
rates of interest on Certificates in
advance of their issuance. To permit
the City to have the flexibility to
undertake, with respect to the Facility Lease and Certificates, interest
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions, from time to time, and to
establish the procedures for approving those transactions, this Council
authorizes the signing and delivery
of one or more agreements (each, a
“Hedge Agreement”), and any related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The terms of those Hedge
Agreements may vary from the
terms of any existing Hedge Agreements. The authorizations in this
Section are supplemental to and not
in derogation of any authority provided by any other ordinance of this
Council
concerning
hedging
arrangements.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be subject
to appropriation and certification as
provided in the Facility Lease.
Those payments may be secured by
the Facility Lease, to the extent permitted by the Trust Agreement, all
as determined by the Director of
Finance and set forth in the Hedge
Agreement. The obligation of the
City to make payments under any
Hedge Agreement does not and
shall not represent or constitute a
general obligation, debt, bonded
indebtedness or a pledge of the faith
and credit of the City or the State
of Ohio. Nothing shall give any
party to any Hedge Agreement the
right to have excises, ad valorem or
other taxes levied by the City or the
State of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to the Facility
Lease or any Certificates issued or
to be issued under the Trust Agreement, the Director of Finance may
authorize one or more interest rate
hedge transactions in accordance
with the applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that the term of each
hedge transaction shall not exceed
the final maturity of the Certificates
to which the hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the payments made or to be
made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, are fair value for the Hedge
Agreement,
considering,
among
other things, the credit of the City,
the credit of the counterparty and
the terms and conditions of the
Hedge Agreement. The Director of
Finance shall determine the terms
and conditions of the Hedge Agreement, including without limitation,

The City Record
the rates to be paid by the counterparty to the City or by the City to
the counterparty under the Hedge
Agreement, the time or times and
procedures for the exercise by the
counterparty or the City, as the case
may be, of any option under the
Hedge Agreement, and whether the
obligations of the City under the
Hedge Agreement shall be secured
by a Credit Support Instrument and,
if so, the terms and conditions of
such Credit Support Instrument. The
approval of each interest rate hedge
transaction
by
the
Director
of
Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery
of the applicable Hedge Agreement
by the Director of Finance.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to enter into amendments
or modifications or novations of or
to terminate in whole or in part any
Hedge Agreement or any Credit Support Instrument securing a Hedge
Agreement
if
the
Director
of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the City’s best interests
will be served by such amendment,
modification, novation or termination. Any payments owed by the
City upon such amendment, modification, novation or termination may
be
paid
from
the
proceeds
of
Refunding Certificates or from Fund
Nos. 11 SF 600, 11 SF 601 and 01 SF
001 or from other money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose.
In the event the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the Facility Lease or
the Trust Agreement in connection
with any Hedge Agreement or any
amendment, modification, novation
or termination of any Hedge Agreement, the Mayor and the Director of
Finance are authorized to sign and
deliver a Supplemental Lease and to
signify approval of the Supplemental Trust Agreement, approved as to
form and correctness by the Director of Law. The Director of Finance
is further authorized to develop,
adopt and revise such policies and
procedures
as
the
Director
of
Finance reasonably concludes are
necessary for the evaluation, incurrence,
maintenance,
monitoring,
administration,
legal
compliance
and reporting of any Hedge Agreements.
Section 4. Credit Support Instruments. The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract from time to
time for one or more Credit Support
Instruments for any series of Outstanding Certificates or any Hedge
Agreement if the Director determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, that the
Credit
Support
Instruments
will
result in savings to the City, will
stabilize interest rates or minimize
the
risk
of
increased
interest
expense or increased risks, burdens,
or other costs associated with hedging arrangements or reserve requirements relating to those Certificates.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to agree to the amendment, replacement, assignment or
termination of any such contract if
the Director of Finance determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the City’s
best interests will be served by such
amendment,
replacement,
assignment or termination. In the event

1967

7
the Director of Finance determines
that it is necessary to supplement or
amend the Ground Lease, Facility
Lease or the Trust Agreement in
order to permit the use of or to
amend, replace, assign or terminate
a Credit Support Instrument, the
Mayor and the Director of Finance
are authorized to sign and deliver a
Supplemental Ground Lease or a
Supplemental Lease or both and to
signify approval of the Supplemental Trust Agreement, approved as to
form and correctness by the Director of Law. The cost of obtaining,
amending, replacing, assigning or
terminating each Credit Support
Instrument, except to the extent
paid by the Original Purchaser in
with
the
Purchase
accordance
Agreement
or
the
remarketing
agent in accordance with a remarketing agreement, shall be paid
from the proceeds of Refunding Certificates or the proceeds of remarketing or from Fund Nos. 11 SF 600,
11 SF 601 and 01 SF 001 or from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
Section 5. Refunding of CertifiEscrow
Agreements.
The
cates;
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, one or more
escrow agreements between the City
and the Trustee, as escrow trustee,
providing for, among other matters:
the
investment

holding
in
escrow of the proceeds of Refunding
Certificates to be applied to the
refunding of Refunded Certificates;
application
of
the
moneys
the
derived from those investments to
the payment of the Certificate Payments on Refunded Certificates, and
the irrevocable call for redemption
of Refunded Certificates to be called
for redemption prior to maturity.
The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to each
escrow agreement from proceeds of
Refunding Certificates to the extent
available and then from Fund Nos.
11 SF 600, 11 SF 601 and 01 SF 001
or from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose, as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance. Provision shall be made in
each escrow agreement to give the
Trustee
any
written
notice
of
redemption required under the Trust
Agreement. The Director of Finance
and other City officials, as appropriate under the Charter, shall sign
all documents and take all other
actions necessary or appropriate on
the part of the City to effect each
such refunding in accordance with
the Trust Agreement and to cause
the Refunded Certificates to be
deemed paid and discharged, including without limitation, the retention
of an independent public accounting
firm to verify the mathematical
accuracy of the calculations relating
to the escrow. Upon the issuance
and delivery of a series of Refunding Certificates, the Trustee and the
City are authorized to disburse from
the Funds established and maintained under the Trust Agreement
such amounts of moneys as are in
excess of the balances required by
the Trust Agreement to then be
maintained in those Funds. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
give written notice to the Trustee of

8
the call for redemption of the
Refunded Certificates on the earliest redemption date following the
issuance of the Refunding Certificates, pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the applicable escrow
agreement.
Section 6. Determination of Base
Rent and Terms of Refunding Certificates; Application of Proceeds.
(a) Principal Components and
Term. Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is in furtherance of one
or more of the purposes set forth in
Section 2(b) of this Ordinance that
one or more series of Refunding Certificates be issued to refund Outstanding Certificates, the Director of
Finance is authorized to negotiate
and provide for the terms of the
Refunding Certificates and the Base
Rent, as amended pursuant to a Supplemental Lease, including the final
Lease Term, and the annual and
aggregate principal components of
Base Rent. The principal amount of
each series of Refunding Certificates and the corresponding principal component of Base Rent is to be
the amount set forth in the Purchase Agreement for that series and
shall be the amount determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be necessary (i) to pay
the costs of refunding the Refunded
(ii)
to
fund
any
Certificates,
reserves required under the Trust
Agreement, (iii) to pay costs of any
Credit Support Instruments, (iv) to
pay identified amounts owed under
Hedge Agreements, (v) to pay interest on the Refunding Certificates,
and (vi) to pay costs of issuing the
Refunding Certificates. The Refunding Certificates of each series shall
mature on the dates and in the
respective principal amounts set
forth in the Purchase Agreement for
that series, consistent with this
Ordinance and the Trust Agreement.
(b) Interest. The Refunding Certificates may be issued as obligations bearing interest at fixed or
variable interest rates, based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, as to
the financial advantage to, and best
interests of, the City, as specified in
the Purchase Agreement. If the
Director of Finance so determines
that Refunding Certificates shall be
issued as obligations bearing interest at variable rates, then the
method and procedure by which the
variable rate of interest to be borne
by the Refunding Certificates are to
be determined (whether by reference to a market index, by a remarketing agent or otherwise) shall be
set forth in the applicable Supplemental Trust Agreement; provided
that no Refunding Certificates shall
bear interest at a rate in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) per year
(including any Refunding Certificate held by a provider of a Credit
Support Instrument). The Director
of Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate series of
Refunding Certificates may or may
not permit the holders to tender
their variable rate Refunding Certificates for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates
any series of Refunding Certificates
as variable rate Certificates, and if
the holders of that series of Refund-

The City Record
ing Certificates are to be entitled to
tender those Certificates for purchase, then the Director of Finance
shall also designate in the Purchase
Agreement for those variable rate
Certificates (and may designate others, from time to time, in substitution therefor), the tender agent or
agents (which may be the Trustee)
and
the
remarketing
agent
or
agents (which may be an Original
Purchaser),
which
designations
shall be based on the determination
of the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, that the parties so designated
possess
the
requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements with others in connection with the delivery of the Refunding Certificates, and from time to
time thereafter so long as the
Refunding
Certificates
are
outstanding, as may be determined by
the Director of Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for
(i) the method of determining the
variable interest rates, (ii) the
rights and procedures for tender,
(iii) liquidity or credit support, (iv)
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument, (v) the direct
purchase of tendered Refunding Certificates, and (vi) other arrangements in the best interests of the
City. The Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any
such agreements if the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the City’s best interests
will be served by such termination.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to enter into agreements,
from time to time so long as the
variable rate Refunding Certificates
are outstanding, supplementing or
amending the applicable Supplemental Trust Agreement for a series
of Refunding Certificates as provided in Section 9. The Director of
Finance is authorized to pay any
fees associated with agreements
entered into or terminated pursuant
to this Section from proceeds of
Refunding Certificates, to the extent
permitted by the Trust Agreement
or from Fund Nos. 11 SF 600, 11 SF
601 and 01 SF 001 or from other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
(c)
Optional
and
Mandatory
Redemption. The Refunding Certificates of each series, and the corresponding principal component of
Base Rent, may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity at the
option of the City, if and to the
extent set forth in the Purchase
Agreement for that series. Any
Refunding
Certificates
so
determined to be subject to optional
redemption and maturing by their
stated
terms
after
the
earliest
optional redemption date shall be
subject to redemption at the option
of the City on or after the earliest
optional redemption date in whole
or in part on any date at the
redemption prices set forth in the
Purchase Agreement and in accordance with the applicable Supplemental Trust Agreement. Refunding
Certificates that are subject to
optional redemption may be subject

1968

November 15, 2017
to purchase by the City in lieu of
optional redemption to the extent
provided in the applicable Supplemental
Trust
Agreement.
The
Refunding Certificates designated
in the Purchase Agreement as term
Certificates subject to mandatory
sinking fund redemption shall be
redeemed prior to maturity on each
mandatory redemption date designated in the Purchase Agreement in
the aggregate amount of the sinking fund installment to be paid on
such mandatory redemption date, all
as provided in the Purchase Agreement and in accordance with the
Supplemental Trust Agreement.
(d) Credit Support and Other
Instruments.
The
Director
of
Finance, regardless of whether a
of
Refunding
Certificates
series
bears interest at variable or fixed
rates, is authorized to contract for
one or more Credit Support Instruments, if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the Credit Support Instruments will
result in a savings in the cost of the
financing to the City. The costs of
such Credit Support Instruments
may be paid from proceeds of
Refunding Certificates or from Fund
Nos. 11 SF 600, 11 SF 601 and 01 SF
001 or from other money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose, as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance.
(e) Base Rent. The City acknowledges that the aggregate principal
amount of Base Rent under the
Facility Lease shall be based on the
aggregate principal component of
Outstanding Certificates and that
the interest on the Base Rent shall
be based on the interest components
of the Outstanding Certificates. The
Base Rent to be payable under and
in accordance with the Facility
Lease during any Lease Term shall
be an amount sufficient to cover the
amount of Certificate Payments on
the Outstanding Certificates that
are due and payable during that
Lease Term, and such Base Rent
shall be specified or determined in
an exhibit to the Facility Lease; provided, however, that the City’s payment of Base Rent and Additional
Rent is Subject to Appropriation and
Certification as provided in the
Facility Lease and nothing in the
Facility Lease, the Certificates, the
Trust Agreement, or any Hedge
Agreement constitutes or shall constitute a pledge by the City, or an
obligation of the City, of any taxes
or other moneys to the payments
due thereunder.
(f) Primary Offering Disclosure.
If, in the judgment of the Director
of Finance after consultation with
the Original Purchaser, a disclosure
document is appropriate relating to
the initial offering of one or more

amount of Refunding Certificates
issued;

their respective dates of issuance,
with an identification of whether

redemption of Refunding Certificates of a particular maturity;
(e) the interest rates to be borne
by Refunding Certificates bearing
interest at a fixed rate, the weighted average of which shall not

liquidity
facility
enhancing
the
security for Refunding Certificates
of that series in lieu of a funded
reserve fund;
(i) whether any Refunding Certificates are to be secured by or
payable
from
a
Credit
Support
Instrument.

will be served by causing a series
of Refunding Certificates to be Capital Appreciation Certificates, then
the Director of Finance is authorized to so specify in the Purchase
Agreement.
If
the
Director
of
Finance so determines, then the
authorizations and limitations in
this Section 7 and Section 6 shall be
interpreted and applied in a manner
that the Director of Finance determines to be consistent with the character of Capital Appreciation Certificates.
It is determined that the terms of
the Refunding Certificates and the

so determined within the limitations
set forth in this Ordinance and as
so specified and set forth in the Purchase Agreement will be in the best
interest of the City and consistent
with all legal requirements.
Section 8. Remarketing. In the
event that the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
it is advantageous to the City to
convert the interest on any Outstanding Certificates bearing interest at variable rates to fixed interest rates for a period of time or to
maturity or to convert the interest
on any Outstanding Certificates or
Refunding Certificates to a different
variable rate period or mode, or to
terminate or take other actions with
respect to any existing Credit Support Instrument that will require a
tender and remarketing of any Outstanding
Certificates
under
the
Trust Agreement (such conversion
or other actions and the tender and
remarketing

remarketing
of
Certificates,
the
Director of Finance is authorized to
take such actions as the Director
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, will
facilitate the remarketing of the

terminating
any
Credit
Support
Instrument, and entering into agreements with one or more purchasers
for their direct purchase of the
remarketed Certificates in lieu of a
public offering of the Refunding
Certificates by a remarketing agent.
In the event the Director of Finance
determines that it is necessary in
connection with the remarketing to
supplement or amend the Facility

current market conditions or to permit the use of or to terminate a

series of Certificates then Outstanding under the Trust Agreement by
the deposit of a Credit Support
Instrument in lieu of cash, as permitted and more specifically provided in the Trust Agreement, and to
apply cash released from such special reserve fund to the payment of
costs of remarketing. To the extent
the costs of remarketing are not
paid from any cash released from
such special reserve fund, those
costs may be paid, as determined by
the Director of Finance, from the
proceeds of remarketing or from
Fund Nos. 11 SF 600, 11 SF 601 and
01 SF 001 or from other money lawfully available and appropriated or
to be appropriated for that purpose.
The Director of Finance is authorized to prepare one or more disclosure documents in connection with

requirements
of
this
Refunding Bond Legislation and the
Indenture.
Separate
series
of
Refunding Bonds may be issued at
the same or different times. The
Refunding Bonds of each series
shall be designated as provided in
the applicable Certificate of Award.
A separate Certificate of Award and
a separate Supplemental Indenture
may be delivered for each series.
Costs of issuance of the Refunding
Bonds and any required deposit to
the Bond Service Reserve Fund
attributable to the Refunding Bonds
shall, in each case, be included in
the costs funded from the proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds.
The
Refunding Bonds shall constitute
Bonds for all purposes of the Indenture.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Refunding
Bonds for a purpose provided in this
Ordinance serves a proper, public,
municipal purpose by reducing or

1972

November 15, 2017
stabilizing the cost at which Cleveland Public Power can provide electric power.
Section 4. Authorization of Hedging
Arrangements.
This
Council
finds that by engaging in interest
rate hedging arrangements from
time to time, the City may reduce
its cost of borrowing by optimizing
the relative amounts of fixed and
variable rate obligations and minimizing the risk of variations in its
debt service costs. Certain types of
hedging arrangements (referred to
in this Refunding Bond Legislation
as “swaptions”) may enable the City
to obtain savings prior to the
issuance of Refunding Bonds by providing for an upfront payment to
the City by a financial institution or
other organization that is the counterparty to the hedge arrangement
in consideration of the City’s giving
the counterparty the option to make
effective at a future date an interest rate exchange transaction with
the City. To permit the City to have
the flexibility to undertake interest
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions from time to time, and to
establish the procedures for approving those transactions, this Council
authorizes the signing and delivery
of one or more agreements (each, a
“Hedge Agreement”) and any related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section are supplemental to and not in
derogation of any authority provided by any other ordinance of this
Council
concerning
hedging
arrangements, and are all subject to
the requirements and restrictions of
the Indenture.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Bonds
issued or to be issued under the
Indenture, the Director of Finance
may authorize one or more interest
rate hedge transactions in accordance with the applicable Hedge
Agreement; provided that the term
of each hedge transaction shall not
exceed the final maturity of the
Bonds to which the hedge relates or
(in the case of an option) will
relate.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the upfront payment or the
periodic payments, as the case may
be, to be made by the counterparty
to the City, or by the City to the
counterparty, shall be fair value for
the Hedge Agreement, given the
credit of the counterparty and the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall determine the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement,
including without limitation, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of its
option under the Hedge Agreement,
whether the obligations of the City
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
secured by a Credit Support Instrument, and the rates to be paid by
the counterparty to the City and by

November 15, 2017
the City to the counterparty under
the Hedge Agreement in the event
of the exercise of the option. The
approval of each interest rate hedge
transaction
by
the
Director
of
Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery
of the applicable Hedge Agreement
by the Director of Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into an amendment,
modification or novation of any
Hedge Agreement or any Credit Support Instrument securing a Hedge
Agreement or to terminate any
Hedge Agreement, in whole or in
part, if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
(a) the amendment, modification,
novation or termination is (i) justified by the corresponding benefit to
the City, (ii) commercially reasonable based on then-current market
conditions, and (iii) in the City’s
best interests, and (b) any payments
made or to be made by the counterparty to the City, or by the City to
the counterparty, are fair value for
such amendment, modification, novation or termination, given the credit of the counterparty and the terms
and conditions of the amendment,
modification, novation or termination. To the extent that any amounts
to be paid by the City in connection
with any such amendment, modification, novation or termination are
not paid from proceeds of Bonds,
those amounts shall be paid from
Fund No. 58-001, as determined by
the Director of Finance after consultation with the Director of Public Utilities.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Net Revenues and the
Pledged Funds as permitted by the
Indenture, and may be payable also
from other funds permitted by law
to be used for the purpose, as identified by the Director of Finance in
the Hedge Agreement. Those payments may be secured by a pledge
of
the
Net
Revenues
and
the
Pledged Funds to the extent permitted by the Indenture, all as determined by the Director of Finance
and set forth in the Hedge Agreement. The obligation of the City to
make payments under any Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not
represent or constitute a general
obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a pledge of the faith and
credit of the City or the State of
Ohio. Nothing gives any party to
any Hedge Agreement the right to
have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
In the event the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the Indenture or a
Supplemental Indenture in connection with any Hedge Agreement or
any amendment, modification, novation or termination of any Hedge
Agreement,
the
Mayor
and
the
Director of Finance are authorized
to sign and deliver a Supplemental
Indenture or amendment of an existing Supplemental Indenture.
Section 5. Terms of Refunding
Bonds. The Refunding Bonds shall
contain the terms provided in or

The City Record
determined pursuant to, the Indenture, this Refunding Bond Legislation, the Certificate of Award and
the Supplemental Indenture.
(a) General. In the event that the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best
interests will be served by causing
a series of Refunding Bonds to be
Variable Rate Bonds, then the Director of Finance is authorized to so
specify in the Certificate of Award.
If the Director of Finance so determines, then the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the Refunding Bonds of that series shall be
determined as provided in the Supplemental Indenture, whether by reference to a market index, by a
remarketing agent or otherwise, provided that no series of variable rate
Refunding Bonds shall bear interest
at a rate in excess of twenty-five
percent (25%) per year (including
any Refunding Bonds held by a
provider of a Credit Support Instrument). The Director of Finance may
determine that the terms of a variable rate series of Refunding Bonds
may or may not permit the holders
to tender their variable rate Refunding Bonds for purchase by the City.
If the Director of Finance designates any series of Refunding Bonds
as Variable Rate Bonds, and if the
Holders of that series of Refunding
Bonds are to be entitled to tender
those Refunding Bonds for purchase, then the Director of Finance
shall also designate for those variable rate Refunding Bonds (and
may designate others, from time to
time, in substitution therefor) the
tender agent or agents and the
remarketing agent or agents, which
designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the
delivery
of
the
Refunding
Bonds, and from time to time thereafter so long as the Refunding
Bonds
are
outstanding,
with
providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents
(which may be any of the Original
Purchasers) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender and providing for payment
of the purchase price of, or debt service on, the variable rate Refunding
Bonds.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
any series of Refunding Bonds, and
regardless of whether that series of
Refunding Bonds bears interest at
variable or fixed rates, is authorized
to contract for a Credit Support
Instrument, and to pay the costs of
it from proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds, if the Director determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instrument will result in a
savings in the cost of the financing
to the City.

1973

13
In the event that the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best interests
will be served by causing a series
of Refunding Bonds to be Capital
Appreciation Bonds, then the Director of Finance is authorized to so
specify in the Certificate of Award.
If the Director of Finance so determines, then the authorizations and
limitations in this Section 5 and Section 6 shall be interpreted and
applied in a manner that the Director of Finance determines to be consistent with the character of Capital
Appreciation Bonds.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into agreements with
others in connection with the delivery of the Refunding Bonds, and
from time to time thereafter so long
as the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, as may be determined by
the Director of Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for
(i) the method of determining the
variable interest rates, (ii) the
rights and procedures for tender,
(iii) liquidity or credit support, (iv)
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument, (v) the direct
purchase of tendered Refunding
Bonds, and (vi) other arrangements
in the best interests of the City. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any such agreements if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be
served by such termination. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to enter into agreements, from
time to time so long as the variable
rate Refunding Bonds are outstanding, supplementing or amending the
applicable Supplemental Indenture
for a series of Refunding Bonds as
provided in Section 8. To the extent
that any fees and expenses associated with agreements entered into
or terminated pursuant to this Section are not paid from proceeds of
Bonds, those fees and expenses shall
be paid from Fund No. 58-001, as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance after consultation with the
Director of Public Utilities.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Refunding Bonds shall be issued
in
fully
registered
form.
The
Refunding Bonds initially shall be
delivered only in book-entry form,
shall be registered in the name of
the Depository or its nominee, as
registered owner, and immobilized
in the custody of the Depository,
and shall not be transferable or
exchangeable (except for transfer to
another Depository or its nominee)
without further action by the City
pursuant to the provisions of the
Supplemental Indenture. No Refunding Bonds shall be exchanged for or
transferable into a coupon Revenue
Bond or Bonds except to the extent
that the Indenture permits such
exchanges or transfers.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Refunding Bonds of any
series for use in a book entry system, the Director of Finance and the
Trustee may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance and the Trustee do not or
are unable to do so, the Director of

14
Finance and the Trustee, after making provision for notification of the
beneficial
owners
by
the
then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit withdrawal of the Refunding
Bonds of any series from the Depository, and authenticate and deliver
registered Bond certificates to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of action
or inaction of the City, of those persons requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into any agreements
determined by the Director to be
necessary in connection with the
book entry system for the Refunding Bonds, after determining that
those agreements will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
under the Indenture (as evidenced
by the Director’s signing of those
agreements).
(c) Dates; Denominations. The
Refunding Bonds of each series
shall be dated as of the date or
dates provided in the Certificate of
Award for that series. The Refunding Bonds of each series shall be

series. The Refunding Bonds of each
series shall bear interest from the
most recent date to which interest
has been paid or duly provided for
or, if no interest has been paid or
duly provided for, from their date.
The principal and any redemption
premium and the interest payable on
each series of Refunding Bonds
shall be payable at the times, to the
persons and in the manner set forth
in, or referenced by, the Supplemental Indenture, including, without
limitation, provisions thereof permitting special arrangements for
payments to the Depository.
(e) Maturities. The Refunding
Bonds of each series shall mature
on the Principal Retirement Dates
and in accordance with the Principal Retirement Schedule specified in
the Certificate of Award, consistent
with this Refunding Bond Legislation and the Indenture and subject
to any provisions for their optional

in the Certificate of Award pursuant
to this Refunding Bond Legislation.
(f)
Optional
and
Mandatory
Redemption. The Refunding Bonds
of each series may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity at the
option of the City, if and to the
extent so provided in the Certificate
of Award for that series. Any
Refunding Bonds so determined to
be subject to optional redemption
and maturing by their stated terms
after the earliest optional redemption date shall be subject to redemption at the option of the City on or
after the earliest optional redemption date in whole or in part on any
date at the redemption prices provided in the Certificate of Award
and in accordance with the Indenture. The Refunding Bonds designated in the Certificate of Award as

the Refunding Bonds are issued in
more than one series sold at different times, a separate Certificate of

Each series of Refunding Bonds
shall bear such designation as the
Director of Finance determines to be

the best interests of the City to terminate a Hedge Agreement relating
to Outstanding Bonds; and (f)  to an
account to be created under the
Indenture for the payment of costs

Refunding Bonds and refunding the
Refunded Bonds. The proceeds from

appropriated and shall be used for
the purposes for which the Refunding Bonds are issued as provided in
this Refunding Bond Legislation.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, in the

Section 8. Supplemental Indenture.
In order to secure the payment of
Bond Service Charges as and when
due and payable, the Director of
Finance and the Director of Public
Utilities are hereby authorized, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
to make, execute, acknowledge and
deliver to the Trustee, a Supplemental Indenture, approved as to
form and correctness by the Director of Law, not inconsistent with
this Refunding Bond Legislation,
the Certificate of Award and the
Indenture
and
not
substantially
adverse to the City as may be

The City Record
approved by the officers executing
the same on behalf of the City. The
determination by such officers that
the Supplemental Indenture is not
substantially adverse to the City
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the execution of the Supplemental
Indenture by such officers. This
Refunding Bond Legislation shall
constitute a part of the Supplemental Indenture as therein provided
and for all purposes thereof, including, without limitation, the application to this Refunding Bond Legislation of the provisions of the Supplemental

modification,
supplementation and severability.
Section 9.  Tax Covenants. With
respect to Refunding Bonds that are
to be issued and sold as Tax-Exempt
Bonds, the City covenants that it
will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Tax-Exempt Bonds in such manner and to such extent as may be
necessary so that (a) the interest on
Tax-Exempt
Bonds
will
be
the
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and (b) in
the case of any Tax-Exempt Bonds
qualifying as bonds, the interest on
which is not treated as an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of
the Code (“Non-AMT Bonds”), such
Tax-Exempt Bonds will be treated
as Non-AMT Bonds.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the TaxExempt Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds to the governmental purposes
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield on investment property, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds and, as applicable, of
property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
The Director of Finance, or any
other officer of the City having
responsibility for issuance of the
Tax-Exempt Bonds, is hereby authorized (a) to make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice,
consent, approval, or waiver on
behalf of the City with respect to
the Tax-Exempt Bonds as the City
is permitted or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
the favorable tax treatment or status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds or
interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose,
reducing
the
burden
or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
of penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or

1975

15
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
and (c) to give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for
inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City regarding the
amount and use of all the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the TaxExempt Bonds.
Each covenant made in this Section 9 with respect to the TaxExempt Bonds is also made with
respect to all issues any portion of
the debt service on which is paid
from proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds (and, if different, the original
issue and any refunding issues in a
series of refundings), to the extent
such compliance is necessary to
assure exclusion of interest on the
Tax-Exempt
Bonds
from
gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified
above are authorized to take actions
with respect to those issues as they
are authorized in this Section to
take with respect to the TaxExempt Bonds.
Section 10.  Additional Documents.
The Director of Finance, the Director of Public Utilities and other City
officials, as appropriate, are authorized to sign and deliver such

of Refunding Bonds to the Original
Purchaser and to take all actions
necessary to effect due signing,
authentication and delivery of each
series of Refunding Bonds under the
terms of this Refunding Bond Legislation, the Supplemental Indenture, the Bond Purchase Agreement
and the Indenture. The Clerk of

aggregate net present value debt
service savings of at least three percent (3%), or to eliminate or modify covenants that are unduly restrictive, or to obtain a more favorable

short-term or variable-rate obligations, this Council authorizes the

1977

17
City to issue Refunding Bonds to
refund such Outstanding Revenue
Bonds, or designated portions thereof, for any of the foregoing purposes or for the purpose that the Director of Finance has determined,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that such Outstanding Revenue Bonds are subjecting the City to undesirably high
rates of interest or undesirable fluctuations in rates of interest or risks
or expenses associated with Credit
Support
Instruments
or
Hedge
Agreements that can economically
be avoided or mitigated through
refunding. The principal amount of
each Series of Refunding Bonds is
to be the amount set forth in the
Certificate of Award authorized in
Section 5 and determined by the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, to be necessary (i) to refund the
Refunded Bonds to be refunded by
that Series, (ii) to fund any interest

fund any deposit to the Bond Service Reserve Fund required under

reserve fund for that Series separate

Fund, (iv) to fund any deposit to

required under the Trust Indenture,
(v) to pay costs of any Credit Support Instruments, (vi) to pay any

the
Refunding
Bonds
and
refunding the Refunded Bonds.
Separate
series
of
Refunding
Bonds may be issued at the same or
different
times.
The
Refunding
Bonds of each series shall be designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of Award. A separate
Certificate of Award and a separate
Supplemental
Indenture
may
be
delivered for each series. The proceeds from the sale of each Series
of Refunding Bonds shall be allocated, deposited and applied as provided in Section 6. The Refunding
Bonds
shall
constitute
Revenue
Bonds for all purposes of the Trust
Indenture.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Refunding
Bonds for a purpose provided in this
Ordinance serves a proper, public,
municipal purpose by reducing or
stabilizing costs of air travel facilities serving the people of the City
of Cleveland, thereby increasing and
promoting commerce by providing
necessary transportation for individuals and commercial enterprises
purchasing and selling services and
products in northeastern Ohio, and
creating and preserving jobs and
employment opportunities in the
City and improving the economic
welfare of the City.
Section 3. Authorization of Hedging Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging
in
interest
rate
hedging
arrangements with respect to Revenue Bonds the City may reduce its
cost of borrowing by optimizing the
relative amounts of fixed and variable rate obligations, or minimizing
the risk of variations in its debt service costs, or obtaining savings by
confirming rates of interest on Revenue Bonds in advance of their
issuance. To permit the City to have
the flexibility to undertake interest

18
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions, from time to time, and to
establish the procedures for approving those transactions, this Council
authorizes the signing and delivery
of one or more agreements (each, a
“Hedge Agreement”) and any related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section 3 are supplemental to and not
in derogation of any authority provided by any other ordinance of this
concerning
hedging
Council
arrangements, and all are subject to
the requirements and restrictions of
the Trust Indenture.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Revenue
Bonds issued or to be issued under
the Trust Indenture, the Director of
Finance may authorize one or more
interest rate hedge transactions in
accordance
with
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement; provided that the
term of each hedge transaction shall
not exceed the final maturity of the
Revenue Bonds to which the hedge
relates.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the payments made or to be
made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, shall be fair value for the
Hedge
Agreement,
considering,
among other things, the credit of
the City’s Airport System, the credit of the counterparty and the terms
and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. The Director of Finance shall
determine the terms and conditions
of the Hedge Agreement, including
without limitation, the time or times
and procedures for the exercise by
the counterparty or the City, as the
case may be, of any option under
the Hedge Agreement, whether the
obligations of the City under the
Hedge Agreement shall be secured
by a Credit Support Instrument, and
the rates to be paid by the counterparty to the City and by the City to
the counterparty under the Hedge
Agreement in the event of the exercise of the option. The approval of
each interest rate hedge transaction
by the Director of Finance shall be
conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery of the applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into an amendment,
modification or novation of any
Hedge Agreement or any Credit Support Instrument securing a Hedge
Agreement or to terminate any
Hedge Agreement, in whole or in
part, if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
(a) the amendment, modification,
novation or termination is (i) justified by the corresponding benefit to
the City, (ii) commercially reasonable based on then-current market
conditions, and (iii) in the City’s
best interests, and (b) any payments
made or to be made by the counterparty to the City, or by the City to

The City Record
the counterparty, are fair value for
such amendment, modification, novation or termination, given the credit of the counterparty and the terms
and conditions of the amendment,
modification, novation or termination. To the extent that any amounts
to be paid by the City in connection
with any such amendment, modification, novation or termination are
not paid from proceeds of Revenue
Bonds, those amounts shall be paid
from Fund Nos. 60SF 001, 60 SF 104,
60 SF 105, 60 SF 106 and 60 SF 141
and/or passenger facility charges,
as determined by the Director of
Finance after consultation with the
Director of Port Control.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from
the
Airport
Revenues
as
defined in the Trust Indenture and
may be payable also from other
funds permitted by law to be used
for the purpose, as identified by the
Director of Finance in the Hedge
Agreement. Those payments may be
secured by a pledge of Airport Revenues, to the extent permitted by
the Trust Indenture, all as determined by the Director of Finance
and set forth in the Hedge Agreement. The obligation of the City to
make payments under any Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not
represent or constitute a general
obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a pledge of the faith and
credit of the City or the State of
Ohio. Nothing gives any party to
any Hedge Agreement the right to
have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
In the event the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the Trust Indenture
or a Supplemental Indenture in connection with any Hedge Agreement
or any amendment, modification,
novation or termination of any
Hedge Agreement, the Mayor and
the Director of Finance are authorized to sign and deliver a Supplemental Indenture or amendment of
an existing Supplemental Indenture.
Section 4. Terms of Refunding
Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall contain the terms provided in or determined pursuant to, the Trust Indenture, this Ordinance, the applicable
Certificate of Award and the applicable Supplemental Indenture. Each
series of Refunding Bonds may be
secured by a separate Supplemental
Indenture, or a single Supplemental
Indenture may secure more than one
series of Refunding Bonds.
(a) General. The Refunding Bonds
may be issued as obligations bearing interest at fixed or variable
interest rates. In the event that the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best
interests will be served by a series
of Refunding Bonds bearing interest
at variable interest rates, then provision shall be made in the Supplemental Indenture applicable to that
series for the method and procedure
by which the variable rate of interest to be borne by the Refunding
Bonds of that series shall be determined (whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing

1978

November 15, 2017
agent or otherwise); provided that
no series of variable rate Refunding
Bonds shall bear interest at a rate
in excess of twenty-five percent
(25%) per year (including any
Refunding Bonds held by a provider
of a Credit Support Instrument). The
Director of Finance may determine
that the terms of a variable rate
series of Refunding Bonds may or
may not permit the holders to tender their variable rate Refunding
Bonds for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates
any series of Refunding Bonds as
variable rate Refunding Bonds, and
if the Holders of that series of
Refunding Bonds are to be entitled
to tender those Refunding Bonds for
purchase,
then
the
Director
of
Finance shall also designate for
those variable rate Refunding Bonds
(and may designate others, from
time to time, in substitution therefor), the tender agent or agents
(which may be the Trustee) and the
remarketing agent or agents (which
may be any of the Original Purchasers), which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the parties so designated
possess the requisite resources and
experience to provide the services
required of them and that the terms
on which the designated parties
have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
In the event that the Director of
based
on
the
written
Finance,
advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best interests
will be served by causing a series
of Refunding Bonds to be Capital
Appreciation Bonds, then the Director of Finance is authorized to so
specify in the Certificate of Award.
If the Director of Finance so determines, then the authorizations and
limitations in this Section 4 and Section 5 shall be interpreted and
applied in a manner that the Director of Finance determines to be consistent with the character of Capital
Appreciation Bonds.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into agreements with
others in connection with the delivery of the Refunding Bonds, and
from time to time thereafter so long
as the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, as may be determined by
the Director of Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for
(i) the method of determining the
variable interest rates, (ii) the
rights and procedures for tender,
(iii) liquidity or credit support, (iv)
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument, (v) the direct
purchase of tendered Refunding
Bonds, and (vi) other arrangements
in the best interests of the City. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any such agreements if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be
served by such termination. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to enter into agreements, from
time to time so long as the variable
rate Refunding Bonds are outstanding, supplementing or amending the
applicable Supplemental Indenture
for a series of Refunding Bonds as
provided in Section 8. To the extent

November 15, 2017
that any fees and expenses associated with agreements entered into
or terminated pursuant to this Section are not paid from proceeds of
Revenue Bonds, those fees and
expenses shall be paid from Fund
Nos. 60 SF 001, 60 SF 104, 60 SF 105,
60 SF 106 and 60 SF 141 and/or passenger facility charges, as determined by the Director of Finance
after consultation with the Director
of Port Control.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Refunding Bonds shall be issued
in
fully
registered
form.
The
Refunding Bonds initially shall be
delivered only in book-entry form,
shall be registered in the name of
the Depository or its nominee, as
registered owner, and immobilized
in the custody of the Depository,
and shall not be transferable or
exchangeable (except for transfer to
another Depository or its nominee)
without further action by the City
pursuant to the provisions of the
Trust Indenture.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Refunding Bonds of any
series for use in a book entry system, the Director of Finance and the
Trustee may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance and the Trustee do not or
are unable to do so, the Director of
Finance and the Trustee, after making provision for notification of the
owners
by
the
then
beneficial
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit withdrawal of the Refunding
Bonds of any series from the Depository, and authenticate and deliver
registered Bond certificates to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of action
or inaction of the City, of those persons requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into any agreements
determined by the Director to be
necessary in connection with the
book entry system for the Refunding Bonds, after determining that
those agreements will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
under the Indenture (as evidenced
by the Director’s signing of those
agreements).
(c) Dates; Denominations. The
Refunding Bonds of each series
shall be dated as of the date or

interest at different interest rates.

shall bear interest from the most

Res. No. 1376-17.
By Council Member Zone.
An emergency resolution supporting Cuyahoga County Council Ordinance No. O2017-0006, sponsored by
Cuyahoga County Council Members
Simon and Miller, to charge a disposable bag fee, and urging its passage by all members of that body in
order to minimize the deleterious
effects of pollution caused by disposable bags on the environment
and create a fund to effect positive
clean-up activities.
Whereas, the precipitous increase
in plastic production and plastic
consumption over the past seventy
years has resulted in approximately
269,000 tons of globally distributed
plastic waste pollution, particularly
in oceans, lakes, and other marine
waterways; and
Whereas, Lake Erie is one of our
greatest resources; and
Whereas, Cleveland sits in the
middle of the southern shore of
Lake Erie and 5.5 million pounds of
plastic pollution contaminates Lake

Erie every year, the second most
plastic pollution of all the Great
Lakes; and
Whereas, plastic waste is not biodegradable and recycled plastic suffers from polymer degradation, limiting its useful life as a recyclable
material, inevitably resulting in
non-biodegradable microplastic particle pollution; and
Whereas,
discarded
disposable
bags are a major source of litter,
pollute our open spaces, harm and
kill wildlife, clog storm drains
resulting in localized flooding, end
up as debris in our neighborhoods
and waterways, and contribute to
blight; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County residents use over 319 million single use
carryout bags annually, contributing to one million tons of landfill
waste every year; and
Whereas, the typical useful life of
a plastic bag is 12 minutes; and
Whereas, the pollution from disposable
bags
imposes
external
cleanup, removal and processing
costs on our communities; and
Whereas, there is a compelling
public interest in discouraging the
wasteful use of disposable bags,

1989

mitigating the negative impact disposable bags have on our environment, and in defraying the costs of
preventing and remediating environmental hazards; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County Council currently has before it a proposed ordinance to charge fees in
the amount not to exceed $.10 per
bag, for carry out bags on certain
retail establishments throughout the
County; and
Whereas, this proposed ordinance
exempts Electronic Benefit Transfer
(EBT) recipients and stores under
7000 square feet in order to ameliorate the costs for low-income persons and “mom and pop” retail
establishments; and
Whereas, the proceeds from these
fees will be used for pollution related clean-up activities including, but
not limited to watershed, beachfront,
roadway
and
greenspace
litter
reduction efforts, as well as purchases of re-usable bags for residents of Cleveland and Cuyahoga
County, and other efforts to minimize pollution and make our region
cleaner; and,
Whereas, this Council supports
the desire to combat the polluting

30
effects of an accompanying blight
caused by disposable bags on the
environment in Cleveland and all of
Cuyahoga County, as well as to promote
sustainability
in
northeast
Ohio by providing for a fund generated by these fees to provide for
critical pollution prevention, remediation, and sustainability services as
set forth in Cuyahoga County Ordinance No. O2017-0006; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

the City of Cleveland:

and create a fund to effect positive

An emergency resolution supporting efforts to shop locally this holiday season, and declaring November
25 through December 25, 2017, Shop
Local and Handmade Month in the
City of Cleveland.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
home to many local shops, markets
and events that sell handmade gifts
by local makers this holiday season;
and
Whereas,
the
latest
National
Retail Federation survey estimates
that the average American consumer will spend $935.58 during the
holiday season on gifts, food, and
other seasonal items; and
Whereas, the majority of holiday
shoppers plan to spend their cash at
large department stores, big-name
discount shops, or online, and only
twenty-three percent of respondents
said they planned to shop at a local
or small business; and
Whereas, efforts to shop small
and locally are especially critical
because they bolster the local economy; and
Whereas, since local sales taxes
are often not collected for online
purchases, encouraging residents to
shop at local brick-and-mortar establishments is also a fiscal win for
cities; and
Whereas, this Council wants to
ensure that local businesses and
makers are reaping the benefits of

the season of gift-giving and celebrating
by
