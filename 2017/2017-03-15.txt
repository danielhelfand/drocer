ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 218-17.
By Council Member Kelley.
An emergency resolution strongly
opposing Governor Kasich’s proposed 2017-2018 Budget, which establishes a state centralized filing and
collection
of
municipal
income
taxes,
includes
other
provisions
adverse to municipalities related to
municipal income tax, and modifies
the distribution formula of the Local
Government Fund, all of which will
cause a substantial loss of revenue
needed to support the health, safety, welfare and economic development efforts of the City of Cleveland
and all other Ohio municipalities.
Whereas, with his proposed Budget bill, Ohio Governor Kasich and
his administration will establish a
state-operated program for the centralized filing and collection of Ohio
Municipal Income Tax; and
Whereas, the proposed establishment of centralized collection by the
State effectively usurps from local
governments the authority to impose
and collect Municipal Income Tax
on Corporate Net Profits and will
allow and facilitate any State policy to reduce or phase out this tax
revenue at the local level, as the
State did with the Estate Tax, Commercial Activity Tax and Personal
Property Tax; and
Whereas, the proposed establishment of centralized collection by the
State will increase the City of Cleveland’s financial burdens by further
reducing revenue and by effectively
severing
Cleveland’s
financial
lifeblood: in 2016 Cleveland collected $44.4 million in Net Profit tax;
the State proposes to distribute the
tax receipts to municipalities on a
quarterly basis, net a 1% collection
fee; and
Whereas, quarterly distribution of
tax receipts would disrupt the City’s
consistent cash flow and seriously
damage the City’s financial stability; and

357

23
Whereas, this proposal eliminates
a municipality’s ability to audit and
verify the accuracy of the tax payments received; and
Whereas, the proposed language
also would eliminate the “throwback” rule, substantially reducing
reportable tax revenue to municipalities with warehouses, distribution centers, and any business providing online sales; and
Whereas, for years, the City’s Central Collection Agency, which collects Cleveland’s local income tax,
as well as the income taxes of 50
other Ohio communities, has provided personal service and assistance
to taxpayers in preparation and filing of tax reports and returns; and
Whereas, only municipalities can
ensure prompt and proper auditing
of local tax returns to guarantee all
applicable deductions and declarations are reported, thus making sure
all taxpayers pay their fair share
without causing higher costs of compliance for everyone; and
Whereas, although the State has
said its proposal would eliminate
the supposed confusion over the different municipal tax laws under
which businesses located in more
than one municipality must file,
Cleveland’s
Central
Collection
Agency has never received complaints from businesses regarding
confusion or frustration over cities’
allegedly different tax codes; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that the Governor’s budget proposal
was created for the sole purpose of
restricting a municipality’s ability
to correct and audit business return
filings and to equitably enforce
municipal income tax laws; it will
be used by the state to control the
administrative process of municipal
income tax collections to the benefit of specific taxpayer interests;
and
Whereas, the municipal income
tax is the City of Cleveland’s single
largest revenue source that provides
essential city services and, in turn,
provides a stable quality of life that
residents and businesses alike rely
upon; any forced reduction in this
revenue will have a negative impact
on residents and businesses, creating an environment detrimental to
retaining and attracting business in
Ohio; and
Whereas, because the City of
Cleveland
cannot
afford
more
reduced revenues due to State cuts,
this Council also opposes the State’s
proposed new distribution formula
of the Local Government Fund
(LGF) which will reduce funding to
municipalities deemed to have the
“ability to raise revenue” thus punishing municipalities that may have
increased income taxes in order to
generate revenues lost from the
reductions in the LGF, the elimination of Estate Tax, and the repeal
of the Tangible Personal Property
Tax; and
Whereas, by way of example,
regarding reductions in the LGF: in
2016 Cleveland collected $24.6 million from the LGF; in 2011 the
amount collected through the LGF
was $51.4 million; the City’s accumulated
loss
of
revenue
from
changes in the LGF since 2010 is
$174.1 million dollars; and
Whereas, the proposal for a state
takeover of collection of municipal
income taxes of municipal corporations such as the City of Cleveland

24
is a clear attack on the home rule
powers granted to municipal corporations by the Ohio Constitution;
and
Whereas, the this Council categorically
objects
to
this
latest
attack on municipal home rule
under consideration by the State of
Ohio and urges all municipal corporations to make it clear to the Governor and General Assembly that
this proposed usurpation of constitutionally-granted local municipal
power shall not take place without
a vigorous legal challenge by affected municipal corporations; and
Whereas, the General Assembly
should: request immediate removal
from the 2017-2018 Budget bill of all
language pertaining to municipal
income tax collection and administration; promote upcoming changes
to the Ohio Business Gateway as a
solution for businesses to file municipal income tax returns in a more
simple and efficient manner, with
the Ohio Business Gateway continuing to act only as a portal to remit
payments; and endorse filing tax
returns directly to municipalities
and not the Ohio Department of
Taxation; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly opposes Governor Kasich’s
proposed 2017-2018 Budget, which
establishes a state centralized filing
and collection of municipal income
taxes,
includes
other
provisions
adverse to municipalities related to
municipal income tax, and modifies
the distribution formula of the Local
Government Fund, all of which will
cause a substantial loss of revenue
needed to support the health, safety, welfare and economic development efforts of the City of Cleveland
and all other Ohio municipalities.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to Governor Kasich, to
all members of the Ohio legislature
and to the Ohio Municipal League.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted March 6, 2017.
Effective March 8, 2017.
