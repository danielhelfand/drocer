ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1458-16.
By Council Member Conwell.
emergency
resolution
An
supporting and encouraging Mayor
Jackson and his Administration to
continue and expand the development
smart
city
technology
and
of
collaborative partnerships with the
private sector that will provide social
and economic benefits to the City of
Cleveland and the surrounding region.
Whereas, a smart city is an urban
development vision to integrate
multiple
information
and
communication technology to enhance
quality, performance and interactivity
of urban services to reduce cost and
resource consumption and to improve
contact
between
citizens
and
government; and
Whereas, a smart city makes more
efficient
use
of
physical
infrastructure
through
artificial
intelligence and analytics to support a
strong and healthy economic, social,
and cultural development for the
residents of the city; and
Whereas, a smart city utilizes and
promotes
new
technology
collaborations
to
address
key
challenges such as reducing traffic
congestion, fighting crime, fostering
economic growth, managing the
effects of climate change, and
improving
the
delivery
of
city
services; and
Whereas, a smart city encourages
the inclusive approach to open data
where datasets from municipalities,
community organizations, foundations,
universities, health care institutions
can
be
shared
thus
creating
collaborative
partnerships
in
addressing both local and regional
problems as well as working toward
creative solutions to improve services
and the quality of life for citizens; and
Whereas,
the
proliferation
of
technology is happening at increasing
speed, changing the landscape of
cities, which will promote the change

169

21
in the physical infrastructure of the
city; and
Whereas,
attracting
private
investment into public infrastructure
is essential for new job creation,
economic development, and the City’s
long term economic competitiveness;
and
Whereas, innovation is key to being
competitive in the regional, national
and global marketplace, which is why
the city must embrace new and
innovative ideas and technology
solutions; and
Whereas, smart city public-private
partnerships can identify, finance, and
support capital projects that will
implement a range of smart city
solutions to create new revenues while
expanding the quality of life for
Cleveland residents; and
Whereas,
the
Jackson
Administration has already developed
city
technologies
and
smart
partnerships, including for example
its partnership with NEO CANDO,
Ohio
Community
and
Northeast
Neighborhood Data for Organizing,
using
geographical
information
system (GIS) techniques to enhance
property data in order to identify
vacant and abandoned properties and
prevent more abandonment; and
Whereas, the Administration and its
partners have developed a Smart City
Cleveland project with the United
States Department of Transportation
Federal Transit Administration that
commits
to
using
smart
city
technology
to
improve
surface
transportation,
while
improving
public safety, transit service and
energy security; and
Whereas, other examples of the
development
of
Administration’s
smart city technologies are the
following: 1) parking space indicators
at Cleveland Hopkins Airport used to
indicate which parking spaces are
open or occupied in the parking
garage; 2) video surveillance cameras
in the downtown district and some of
the
City’s
commercial
corridor
providing twenty-four hour video
surveillance;
3)
an
upcoming
downtown project using automated
lighting and monitoring of parking
spaces on West 6th Street and West
9th Street; and 4) an upcoming project
involving
General
Electric
and
Siemens cameras and small lighting;
and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the Administration to expand its
smart city technology efforts and seek
opportunities such as the City of
Columbus’ recent award of $40 million
in federal start-up funds from the
Department
of
Transportation’s
“smart cities” competition to link an
impoverished community to jobs using
driverless vehicles; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports
and encourages Mayor Jackson and
his Administration to continue and
expand the development of smart city
technology
and
collaborative
partnerships with the private sector
that will provide social and economic
benefits to the City of Cleveland and
the surrounding region.

Jackson.

Whereas, problem gambling is a
public health issue affecting millions of Americans of all ages, races
and ethnic backgrounds; and
Whereas, problem gambling has a
significant societal and economic
cost for individuals, families, businesses and communities; and
Whereas, problem gambling is
treatable and treatment is effective

and
Whereas, numerous individuals,
professionals
and
organizations
have dedicated their efforts to educating the public about problem
gambling and the availability and
effectiveness of treatment; and

invite all residents of Cleveland to

February 8, 2017
Whereas, on Friday January 27,
2017, the President of the United
States issued an Executive Order
banning entry into the U.S. for
migrants and U.S. legal residents
from Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia,
Syria, Libya and Yemen, and for
migrants from across the globe; and
Whereas, the Executive order suspends the U.S. Refugee Admissions
Program for a period of 120 days
and limits the entry of refugees into
the U.S. to 50,000 persons for 2017,
when the United States historically
has led the world in the resettlement of refugees, accepting on average more than 79,000 refugees per
year for the last 42 years; and
Whereas, the U.N Refugee Agency
reports that children under the age
of 18 years old constitute 51% of
refugee population in 2015; and
Whereas, this Executive Order is
anathema to our shared values as a
nation of immigrants, a nation that
grants relief and safe haven to people from war-torn countries and
from religious, ethnic and all other
forms of persecution; and
Whereas, this ban enflames U.S.
relations with Muslim-majority countries, indeed with all Muslims, and
will surely make the United States
less safe from acts of terrorism; and
Whereas, in the United States, as
in Cleveland, our success depends on
making sure that all residents feel
welcome; and
Whereas, Cleveland always has
been and continues to be a welcoming city to everyone, including
immigrants who contribute economically and culturally to making our
city a better place; and
immigrants
and
Whereas,
refugees are a vital part of this city:
bringing fresh perspectives and new
ideas; starting businesses; and contributing to Cleveland’s treasured
and vibrant diversity; and
Whereas, this Council honors the
spirit of unity that brings neighbors
together and makes our community
the kind of place where diverse people from around the world feel valued and want to put down roots; and
Whereas, regardless of where we
are born or what we look like, we
are Cleveland residents united in
our efforts to build a stronger community; and
Whereas, this Council understands
that by recognizing the contributions that all of us make to create
a vibrant culture and a growing
economy, we make our city, and our
country, more prosperous and inclusive; and
Whereas, this Executive Order
violates the principles of the U.S.
Constitution; and these executive
orders promote dangerous public
policy, eroding the trust between
public safety agencies and the communities they serve, which ultimately undermine safety in the city
of Cleveland and across our country;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly objects to the Presidential
Executive Order temporarily banning entry into the United States for
migrants from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from

February 8, 2017
around the world and joins with all
Americans who believe that the
Executive Order is unlawful and unAmerican and further, this Council
declares Cleveland, Ohio to be a
“Welcoming City” and calls upon the
people of Cleveland to join together
to build a stronger, united community.
Section 2. That this Council strongly
resolves that the City of Cleveland is
under no obligation to be involved in
federal
immigration
enforcement
under protection of the Fourth and
Tenth Amendments of the U.S.
Constitution.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit a copy of this
resolution to the President of the
United States, Ohio Senators Rob
Portman and Sherrod Brown, Joe
Cimperman, President of Global
Cleveland and to the National League
of Cities.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
