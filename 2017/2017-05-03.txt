(1) When overtaking and passing
another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction, or when making a
left turn under the rules governing
those movements;
(2) When an obstruction exists
making it necessary to drive to the
left of the center of the highway;
provided, any person so doing shall
yield the right-of-way to all vehicles
traveling in the proper direction
upon the unobstructed portion of the
highway within such distance as to
constitute an immediate hazard;
(3) When driving upon a roadway
divided into three (3) or more
marked lanes for traffic under the
rules applicable thereon;
(4) When driving upon a roadway
designated and posted with signs
for one (1) way traffic;

vehicle or trackless trolley proceeding at less than the prevailing and
lawful speed of traffic at the time
and place and under the conditions
then existing shall be driven in the
right-hand lane then available for
traffic, and far enough to the right
to allow passing by faster vehicles
if the passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following circumstances:
A. When overtaking and passing
another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
B. When preparing for a left turn;
C. When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the

slower vehicle to compromise the
driver’s safety to allow overtaking
by a faster vehicle.
(c) Upon any roadway having
four (4) or more lanes for moving
traffic and providing for two (2)
way movement of traffic, no vehicle
or trackless trolley shall be driven
to the left of the centerline of the

official traffic-control devices designating certain lanes to the left of
the center of the roadway for use by

When Proceeding in Opposite Directions
Operators of vehicles and trackless trolleys proceeding in opposite

the speed of his or her vehicle, until
safely past the overtaken bicycle.
The same requirements shall apply
to the operator of a commercial
motor vehicle, commercial truck,
commercial unit, or bus, except that
the safe distance shall not be less
than six (6) feet. However, in the
case of a bus operated by a transit
authority that has implemented a
training program that promotes safe
bus operation while overtaking a
bicycle, that safe distance shall be
not less than three (3) feet.
(c) The operator of a motor vehicle overtaking a bicycle proceeding

Section 431.05 Overtaking, Passing
to Left of Center
No vehicle or trackless trolley
shall be driven to the left of the center of the roadway in overtaking
and passing traffic proceeding in
the same direction, unless such left

the safe operation of any traffic
approaching from the opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In
every event the overtaking vehicle
or trackless trolley must return to
an authorized lane of travel as soon
as practicable, and in the event the
passing movement involves the use
of a lane authorized for traffic
approaching from the opposite direction before coming within two hundred (200) feet of any approaching
vehicle.
(RC 4511.29)
Section 431.06 Additional Restrictions on Driving upon Left Side of
Roadway

municipality that includes a crosswalk customarily used by children
going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing
hours, whenever the distance, as
measured in a straight line, from
the school property line nearest the
crosswalk to the nearest point of a
crosswalk is no more than one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320)

(4) or more lanes for moving traffic
and providing for two (2) way movement of traffic, no vehicle or trackless
trolley shall be driven to the left of

overtaken, shall pass to the left thereof at a safe distance, and shall not
again drive to the right side of the
roadway until safely clear of the overtaken vehicle or trackless trolley.

audible signal, and the operator shall
not increase the speed of the operator’s vehicle until completely passed

speed of his or her vehicle, until safely past the overtaken bicycle. The
same requirements shall apply to the
operator of a commercial motor vehicle, commercial truck, commercial
unit, or bus, except that the safe distance shall not be less than six (6)
feet. However, in the case of a bus
operated by a transit authority that
has implemented a training program
that promotes safe bus operation
while overtaking a bicycle, that safe
distance shall be not less than three
(3) feet.

for two or more lines of vehicles moving lawfully in the direction being
traveled by the overtaking vehicle.

Section 431.05 Overtaking, Passing
to Left of Center
No vehicle or trackless trolley shall
be driven to the left of the center of
the roadway in overtaking and passing traffic proceeding in the same
direction, unless such left side is
clearly visible and is free of oncoming
traffic for a sufficient distance ahead
to permit such overtaking and passing to be completely made, without
interfering with the safe operation of
any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every event the overtaking
vehicle or trackless trolley must
return to an authorized lane of travel
as soon as practicable, and in the
event the passing movement involves
the use of a lane authorized for traffic
approaching from the opposite direction before coming within two hundred (200) feet of any approaching
vehicle.
(RC 4511.29)
Section 431.06 Additional Restrictions on Driving upon Left Side of
Roadway
(a) No vehicle or trackless trolley
shall be driven upon the left side of

The City Record
the roadway under the following conditions:
(1) When approaching the crest of
a grade or upon a curve in the highway, where the operator’s view is
obstructed within such a distance as
to create a hazard in the event traffic
might approach from the opposite
direction;
(2) When the view is obstructed
upon approaching within one hundred (100) feet of any bridge, viaduct
or tunnel;
(3) When approaching within one
hundred (100) feet of or traversing
any intersection or railroad grade
crossing.
(b) This section does not apply to
vehicles or trackless trolleys upon a
one (1) way roadway, upon a roadway where traffic is lawfully directed
to be driven to the left side or under
the conditions described in RC
4511.25(A)(2) or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.
(RC 4511.30)
Section 431.07 Hazardous or No
Passing Zones
(a) Hazardous zones, commonly
called “no passing zones,” shall consist of an auxiliary yellow line
marked on the roadway pavement
and placed parallel to the normal center line or marked lane line. When the
auxiliary yellow line appears on the
left side in the driver’s lane of travel
and to the right of the normal center
line or marked lane line, no driver
shall drive across the auxiliary yellow line to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction. When auxiliary yellow lines
appear on both sides of the normal
center line or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction
shall not drive across such auxiliary
yellow lines to overtake and pass
another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction. No driver shall, at any
other time, drive across the yellow
auxiliary line when it appears in the
driver’s lane of travel, except to make
a lawfully permitted left-hand turn
under the rules governing such movement. No passing signs may also be
erected facing traffic to indicate the
beginning and end of each no passing
zone.
(b) The department of transportation may determine those portions of
any state highway where overtaking
and passing other traffic or driving to
the left of the center or center line of
the roadway would be especially hazardous and may, by appropriate signs
or markings on the highway, indicate
the beginning and end of such zones.
When signs or markings are in place
and clearly visible, every operator of
a vehicle or trackless trolley shall
obey the directions of the signs or
markings, notwithstanding the distances set out in RC 4511.30 and in Section 431.06.
(c) Divisions (a) and (b) of this
section do not apply when all of the
following apply:
(1) The slower vehicle is proceeding at less than half the speed of the
speed limit applicable to that location.
(2) The faster vehicle is capable of
overtaking and passing the slower
vehicle without exceeding the speed
limit.
(3) There is sufficient clear sight
distance to the left of the center or
centerline of the roadway to meet the
overtaking and passing provisions of

718

May 3, 2017
Section 431.05 and RC 4511.29, considering the speed of the slower vehicle.
(RC 4511.31)
Section 431.08 Driving in Marked
Lanes or Continuous Lines of Traffic
(a) Whenever any roadway has
been divided into two (2) or more
clearly marked lanes for traffic or
wherever within the municipality
traffic is lawfully moving in two (2)
or more substantially continuous
lines in the same direction, the following rules apply:
(1) A vehicle or trackless trolley
shall be driven, as nearly as is practicable, entirely within a single lane or
line of traffic and shall not be moved
from such lane or line until the driver
has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety.
(2) Upon a roadway which is divided into three (3) lanes and provides
for two (2) way movement of traffic,
a vehicle or trackless trolley shall not
be driven in the center lane except
when overtaking and passing another vehicle  or trackless trolley where
the roadway is clearly visible and
such center lane is clear of traffic
within a safe distance, or when
preparing for a left turn, or where
such center lane is at the time allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the
direction the vehicle or trackless trolley is proceeding and is posted with
signs to give notice of such allocation.
(3) Official signs may be erected

in division (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3),
(a)(4) or (a)(5) of this section if any

injured in any collision in which the
licensee may be involved. When a
demand is properly made, and the
operator has the operator’s driver’s
license on or about the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to
display the license. A person’s failure
to furnish satisfactory evidence that

have the person’s license on or about
the person’s person shall be prima
facie evidence of the person’s not having obtained a driver’s license.

of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that
the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged
violation of division (a)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor
vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The

owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
(7) The offender shall provide the
court with proof of financial responsibility as defined in RC 4509.01. If the

principal installments. The Series 2017
Bonds stated to mature in any year
may be issued as serial Series 2017
Bonds or as term Series 2017 Bonds
payable prior to stated maturity
pursuant to sinking fund redemption
(the “Term Bonds”). The Director of
Finance shall determine in the
Certificate of Award whether any of
the Series 2017 Bonds shall be issued
as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking
fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal
to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements”).
If any of the Series 2017 Bonds are
issued as Term Series 2017 Bonds, the
Term Bonds shall be redeemed
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements at a
redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount redeemed, plus
interest accrued to the redemption
date, on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates. The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Trustee for
payment of principal of and interest
on any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements (less the amount of any
credit as provided in the Indenture
and the Ninth Supplement).
The Series 2017 Bonds may be
subject
to
redemption
prior
to
maturity by and at the option of the
City, in whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
redemption
dates
and
at
the
redemption prices specified in the
Certificate of Award, plus, in each
case,
accrued
interest
to
the
redemption date. Based on the written
advice of a financial advisor, the
Director of Finance may determine in
the Certificate of Award that it is in
the best interests of the City (i) for
some or all of the Series 2017 Bonds not
to be callable prior to their stated
maturity, and (ii) for a premium to be
payable on the redemption of any
Series 2017 Bonds calculated in a
manner to make the bondholder whole
for the loss of the investment or
calculated as a percentage in excess of
100%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the City may
have the option to purchase any Bond
which is redeemable by optional
redemption at a purchase price not
less than the redemption price that
would be payable if that Bond were
called for optional redemption on the
date of the proposed purchase. That
election shall be exercised as provided
in the Ninth Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the Series 2017
Bonds may be secured by a Debt
Service Reserve Fund to be held by the
Trustee under the Indenture. The
principal amount of the Series 2017
Bonds may include provision for
funding the Debt Service Reserve
Fund from the proceeds of the Series
2017 Bonds, subject to compliance with
applicable federal tax laws.

Code shall apply to the Notes and
pursuant to that authority and this
Ordinance, the Director of Finance
may determine in the Certificate of
Award, based on the written advice of
a financial advisor, that the City’s best
interests will be served by causing all
or a portion of the Notes to be
obligations
bearing
interest
at
variable rates. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the

rate in excess of 25% per year. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
enter into agreements in connection
with the delivery of the variable rate
Notes, and from time to time thereafter
so long as the variable rate Notes are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, to be necessary or
appropriate to provide for the method
of determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right of
tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of the
variable rate Notes upon tender for
purchase
or
redemption,
and
providing for the repayment by the
City of any amounts drawn under the
Credit
Support
Instrument.
The
Trustee shall be the authenticating
agent, registrar, transfer agent and

not
purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased for that
Account, shall be sold at not less than
par and accrued interest to one or
more firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Notes and have been
selected by the Director of Finance
based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (the
“Note Purchaser”) in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of

56
award to be executed by the Director
of Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”). The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund or
funds set forth in the Note Certificate
of Award and used for the purpose for
which the Notes are being issued

Section 4. Terms of the Series 2017
Bonds. The Series 2017 Bonds shall be
issued in fully registered form. The
Series 2017 Bonds may be issued in one

(as
defined
in
the
Indenture)
or
its
nominee,
as
registered owner, and immobilized in
the custody of the Depository, and

or

without further action by the City

identified in Section 7. The Series 2017
Bonds shall be designated “Public
Facilities Improvement Bonds, Series
2017” and may contain such further
designation as provided in the

The Series 2017 Bonds shall be issued
in one lot as fully registered Series
2017 Bonds in denominations of $5,000
or any whole multiple thereof. The
Series 2017 Bonds shall be numbered
as determined by the Director of

be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture.
The Series 2017 Bonds shall be dated
the date of their issuance and delivery
or such other date specified in the
certificate of award providing for the
final terms of the Series 2017 Bonds
and the sale of the Series 2017 Bonds in
accordance with this Ordinance (the
“Certificate of Award”). The Series
2017 Bonds shall bear interest from
their date until the principal amount
is paid at the rate or rates per year
specified in the Certificate of Award,
provided that the yield (determined in
accordance
with
the
arbitrage
provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended) of the Series
2017 Bonds shall not exceed 6% per
year, if sold as fixed rate obligations.
Interest on the Series 2017 Bonds shall
be payable semi-annually on April 1
and October 1, or such other dates
specified in the Certificate of Award
(the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The provisions of Sections  9.98 to
9.983 of the Revised Code shall apply
to the Series 2017 Bonds and pursuant
to that authority and this Ordinance,
the
Director
of
Finance
may
determine in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, that the City’s best
interests will be served by causing all
or a portion of the Series 2017 Bonds to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates. If the Director of

The City Record
Finance so determines, then the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds shall
be determined; provided that the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds shall
not bear interest at a rate in excess of
25% per year. The Director of Finance
is authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds, and
from time to time thereafter so long as
the variable rate Series 2017 Bonds are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, to be necessary or
appropriate to provide for the method
of determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right of
tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds upon
tender for purchase or redemption,
and providing for the repayment by
the City of any amounts drawn under
the Credit Support Instrument.
The Series 2017 Bonds shall mature
in the years and principal amounts set
forth in the Certificate of Award,
provided that (i) each principal
payment shall occur on an Interest
Payment Date, and (ii)  the final
maturity date of the Series 2017 Bonds
shall be no later than August 1, 2031;
provided that the Series 2017 Bonds
shall not have more than 12 annual
principal installments. The Series 2017
Bonds stated to mature in any year
may be issued as serial Series 2017
Bonds or as term Series 2017 Bonds
payable prior to stated maturity
pursuant to sinking fund redemption
(the “Term Bonds”). The Director of
Finance shall determine in the
Certificate of Award whether any of
the Series 2017 Bonds shall be issued
as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking
fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal
to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements”).
If any of the Series 2017 Bonds are
issued as Term Series 2017 Bonds, the
Term Bonds shall be redeemed
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements at a
redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount redeemed, plus
interest accrued to the redemption
date, on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates. The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Trustee for
payment of principal of and interest
on any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements (less the amount of any
credit as provided in the Indenture
and the Ninth Supplement).
The Series 2017 Bonds may be
subject
to
redemption
prior
to
maturity by and at the option of the
City, in whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
redemption
dates
and
at
the
redemption prices specified in the
Certificate of Award, plus, in each

738

May 3, 2017
case,
accrued
interest
to
the
redemption date. Based on the written
advice of a financial advisor, the
Director of Finance may determine in
the Certificate of Award that it is in
the best interests of the City (i) for
some or all of the Series 2017 Bonds not
to be callable prior to their stated
maturity, and (ii) for a premium to be
payable on the redemption of any
Series 2017 Bonds calculated in a
manner to make the bondholder whole
for the loss of the investment or
calculated as a percentage in excess of
100%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the City may
have the option to purchase any Bond
which is redeemable by optional
redemption at a purchase price not
less than the redemption price that
would be payable if that Bond were
called for optional redemption on the
date of the proposed purchase. That
election shall be exercised as provided
in the Ninth Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the Series 2017
Bonds may be secured by a Debt
Service Reserve Fund to be held by the
Trustee under the Indenture. The
principal amount of the Series 2017
Bonds may include provision for
funding the Debt Service Reserve
Fund from the proceeds of the Series
2017 Bonds, subject to compliance with
applicable federal tax laws.

amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director
of Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”). The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund or

of a municipal department; now,
therefore,

Ordinance as security for the General
Obligation Bonds of the City issued
and outstanding under the General
Bond Ordinance, to the full extent
required to meet debt charges payable
on the Bonds issued and outstanding,

on the General Obligation Bonds, the
Bonds
outstanding
under
the
Indenture, any Parity Obligations and
the
Unrestricted
Income
Tax
Obligations (each as defined in the
Indenture).
The
City
further
covenants that so long as any Bonds
are outstanding under the Indenture,
the City shall not repeal or amend, or
suffer the repeal of, any ordinance for
the levy or collection of its income
taxes in any manner or to such extent
that the City would not be able to meet
its obligations to the holders of the
Bonds.
Section 4. Terms of the Series 2017
Bonds. The Series 2017 Bonds shall be
issued in fully registered form. The
Series 2017 Bonds may be issued in one
or more series or subseries. The Series
2017 Bonds may be delivered only in
book-entry form, and if so delivered,
shall be registered in the name of the
Depository
(as
defined
in
the
Indenture)
or
its
nominee,
as
registered owner, and immobilized in
the custody of the Depository, and
shall
not
be
transferable
or
exchangeable (except for transfer to
another Depository or its nominee)
without further action by the City
pursuant to the provisions of the

62
Indenture and the Ninth Supplement
identified in Section 7. The Series 2017
Bonds shall be designated “Bridges
and Roadway Improvement Bonds,
Series 2017” and may contain such
further designation as provided in the
Certificate of Award identified below.
The Series 2017 Bonds shall be issued
in one lot as fully registered Series
2017 Bonds in denominations of $5,000
or any whole multiple thereof. The
Series 2017 Bonds shall be numbered
as determined by the Director of
Finance. The Series 2017 Bonds shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture.
The Series 2017 Bonds shall be dated
the date of their issuance and delivery
or such other date specified in the
certificate of award providing for the
final terms of the Series 2017 Bonds
and the sale of the Series 2017 Bonds in
accordance with this Ordinance (the
“Certificate of Award”). The Series
2017 Bonds shall bear interest from
their date until the principal amount
is paid at the rate or rates per year
specified in the Certificate of Award,
provided that the yield (determined in
accordance
with
the
arbitrage
provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended) of the Series
2017 Bonds shall not exceed 6% per
year, if sold as fixed rate obligations.
Interest on the Series 2017 Bonds shall
be payable semi-annually on April 1
and October 1, or such other dates
specified in the Certificate of Award
(the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The provisions of Sections  9.98 to
9.983 of the Revised Code shall apply
to the Series 2017 Bonds and pursuant
to that authority and this Ordinance,
the
Director
of
Finance
may
determine in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, that the City’s best
interests will be served by causing all
or a portion of the Series 2017 Bonds to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds shall
be determined; provided that the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds shall
not bear interest at a rate in excess of
25% per year. The Director of Finance
is authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds, and
from time to time thereafter so long as
the variable rate Series 2017 Bonds are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, to be necessary or
appropriate to provide for the method
of determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right of
tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds upon
tender for purchase or redemption,
and providing for the repayment by
the City of any amounts drawn under
the Credit Support Instrument.
The Series 2017 Bonds shall mature
in the years and principal amounts set
forth in the Certificate of Award,
provided that (i) each principal
payment shall occur on an Interest
Payment Date, and (ii)  the final
maturity date of the Series 2017 Bonds
shall be no later than August 1, 2036;

The City Record
provided that the Series 2017 Bonds
shall not have more than 17 annual
principal installments. The Series 2017
Bonds stated to mature in any year
may be issued as serial Series 2017
Bonds or as term Series 2017 Bonds
payable prior to stated maturity
pursuant to sinking fund redemption
(the “Term Bonds”). The Director of
Finance shall determine in the
Certificate of Award whether any of
the Series 2017 Bonds shall be issued
as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking
fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal
to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements”).
If any of the Series 2017 Bonds are
issued as Term Series 2017 Bonds, the
Term Bonds shall be redeemed
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements at a
redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount redeemed, plus
interest accrued to the redemption
date, on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates. The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Trustee for
payment of principal of and interest
on any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements (less the amount of any
credit as provided in the Indenture
and the Ninth Supplement).
The Series 2017 Bonds may be
subject
to
redemption
prior
to
maturity by and at the option of the
City, in whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
redemption
dates
and
at
the
redemption prices specified in the
Certificate of Award, plus, in each
case,
accrued
interest
to
the
redemption date. Based on the written
advice of a financial advisor, the
Director of Finance may determine in
the Certificate of Award that it is in
the best interests of the City (i) for
some or all of the Series 2017 Bonds not
to be callable prior to their stated
maturity, and (ii) for a premium to be
payable on the redemption of any
Series 2017 Bonds calculated in a
manner to make the bondholder whole
for the loss of the investment or
calculated as a percentage in excess of
100%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the City may
have the option to purchase any Bond
which is redeemable by optional
redemption at a purchase price not
less than the redemption price that
would be payable if that Bond were
called for optional redemption on the
date of the proposed purchase. That
election shall be exercised as provided
in the Ninth Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the Series 2017
Bonds may be secured by a Debt
Service Reserve Fund to be held by the
Trustee under the Indenture. The
principal amount of the Series 2017
Bonds may include provision for
funding the Debt Service Reserve
Fund from the proceeds of the Series
2017 Bonds, subject to compliance with
applicable federal tax laws.

specify in the Certificate of Award the
method and procedure by which the

Director of Finance is authorized to
enter into agreements in connection
with the delivery of the variable rate
Notes, and from time to time thereafter
so long as the variable rate Notes are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, to be necessary or
appropriate to provide for the method

rates, permitting holders the right of
tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of the
variable rate Notes upon tender for
purchase
or
redemption,
and
providing for the repayment by the
City of any amounts drawn under the
Credit
Support
Instrument.
The

the Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased for that
Account, shall be sold at not less than
par and accrued interest to one or
more firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Notes and have been

based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (the

amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director
of Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”). The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund or
funds set forth in the Note Certificate
of Award and used for the purpose for
