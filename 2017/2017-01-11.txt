this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Superintendent of Liquor Control within 30
days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:

Res. No. 38-17.
By Council Member Kelley.
An emergency resolution urging
Giant Eagle not to close two local
stores and a Get-Go gas station in
Cleveland, and to work with the
City of Cleveland to retain these
stores in order to preserve access to
fresh foods and pharmacy services
for east and west side residents.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has been a partner with Giant Eagle
over the years, working towards the
development of new grocery stores
and Get-Go gas stations within the
City limits; and
Whereas, the recently announced
closing in February of two stores
located at East 116th Street and
Buckeye Road and 140th Street and
Lorain Avenue, and a Get-Go gas
station leaves only two Giant Eagle
stores left in a community of nearly 400,000 people, and marks the end
of Giant Eagle on the east side of
Cleveland; and
Whereas,
these
stores
provide
access to fresh foods and pharmacy
service
for
Cleveland
residents,
many of who are elderly and rely
on public transportation; and
Whereas, the impending closing of
three locations, puts 120 workers at
risk of losing their jobs; and
Whereas, the closing of pharmacies in mid-January leaves little
time for customers to transfer prescriptions, placing a hardship especially on our seniors and those with
disabilities; and
Whereas, if these Giant Eagle
stores close, the remaining lease
terms may prevent other grocery
stores from leasing at these locations, leaving vacant stores that
negatively influence our community
and affect other leases for nearby
retail; and
