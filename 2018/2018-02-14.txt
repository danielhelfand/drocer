ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 5-18.
By Council Members Conwell and
Zone.
An emergency resolution supporting the Vision Zero initiative, a
strategy to eliminate all traffic
fatalities and severe injuries, while
increasing safe, healthy, equitable
mobility for all, and committing to
work with the Jackson administration and community stakeholders to
create a Vision Zero plan for the
City.
Whereas, Vision Zero began in
Sweden as a notably different way
of ensuring that people have the
right to move about their communities safely, setting “zero” as the
“only justifiable fatality target for
road traffic”; and
Whereas, Sweden has one of the
lowest annual rates of road deaths
in the world: 3 out of 100,000; the
annual road death rate in the United States is 12.3 out of 100,000; and
Whereas, in Ohio in 2016, there
were 1,134 traffic fatalities, which is
a 2% increase over 2015; in Ohio,
traffic fatalities have risen 3 years
in a row; and
Whereas, from 2011-2015 in Cuyahoga County there were 120,032
crashes, with the largest percentage
of crashes being in the City: 44% of
total crashes and 38% of fatal and
serious
injury
crashes
were
in
Cleveland during that time period;
and
Whereas, the Vision Zero message
is that traffic-related fatalities and
injuries are neither an inevitable
nor an acceptable side-effect of a
transportation system, but are preventable; and
Whereas, to achieve Vision Zero
there
must
be
a
commitment
between government, relevant agencies and community stakeholders to
cooperate and collaborate; a strong
focus on a systems-based approach
to the environment, practices, and
policies that influence behavior;
efforts to gather, analyze, use, and
share data to understand specific
traffic safety issues and prioritize
resources; and
Whereas, Vision Zero policies or
plans have been adopted by numerous cities in the United States,
including Chicago, New York, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Richmond,
Virginia and Durham, North Carolina; and
Whereas, this Council will establish a Vision Zero taskforce with
the Administration and key stakeholders to help create a Vision Zero
plan for the City of Cleveland to
address meaningful changes to traffic enforcement, land use and transportation ordinances; and
Whereas, the City’s Vision Zero
plan will build upon policies that
the City already has in place, including the Complete and Green Streets
legislation, Ordinance No. 798-11,
passed September 19, 2011, and section 433.09 of the Codified Ordinances
which
prohibits
texting
while driving; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,

The City Record
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Vision Zero initiative, a
strategy to eliminate all traffic
fatalities and severe injuries, while

Ord. No. 120-18.
By Council Member Kelley (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Sections 192.57 to 192.72, relating to the collection and administration of net profit taxes.
Whereas, in House Bill (H.B.) 49
of the 132nd General Assembly, the
State’s general appropriations bill
for the biennium, includes Section
803.100 purporting to require that
municipalities, on or before January
31, 2018, adopt certain municipal
income tax provisions that are also
adopted within H.B. 49 to authorize
State officials to collect and administer municipal net profits taxes;
and
Whereas, Section 803.100 of H.B. 49
references and relies upon Section
718.04(A) of the Ohio Revised Code,
which purports to make municipal
income taxing authority conditional
upon a municipality’s adoption of
code sections as dictated by the
State; and
Whereas, although the municipal
income tax provisions of H.B. 49,
and Section 718.04(A) of the Ohio
Revised Code, violate the Home
Rule Amendment, the City nevertheless is compelled to adopt H.B.
49’s municipal income tax provisions, on or before January 31, 2018,
to avoid any doubt or taxpayer challenge as to its ability to impose a
municipal income tax under the

16
terms of Section 803.100 of H.B. 49
and Section 718.04(A) of the Ohio
Revised Code; and
Whereas, the City is a party to
ongoing litigation seeking a declaration that the H.B. 49 municipal
income
tax
provisions,
Section
718.04(A) of the Ohio Revised Code,
and other provisions of Ohio law
that usurp the powers of local selfgovernment
are
unconstitutional,
and to enjoin all actions by state
officials to implement the H.B. 49
municipal income tax provisions;
and
Whereas, the City, by enacting
this Ordinance, does not concede the
legality
of
H.B.
49’s
municipal
income
tax
provisions,
Section
718.04(A) of the Ohio Revised Code,
or any other law that is subject to
the suit in which the City is participating, and reserves its right to
continue prosecution of that lawsuit;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby expressly finds and determines
that it does not concede the legality of H.B. 49’s municipal income tax
provisions; Section 803.100 of H.B. 49;
Section
718.04(A)
of
the
Ohio
Revised Code; or any other law that
is the subject of the action pending
in Case Number 2017 CV 10258 in the
Franklin County Court of Common
Pleas, and that the City reserves its
rights to continue its participation
in and prosecution of said litigation,
and any other litigation challenging
the
State’s
authority
to
dictate
municipal tax collection and administration, and that adoption of this
Ordinance shall not prejudice the
claims of the City therein.
Section 2. That, notwithstanding
Section 1 of this ordinance, the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio,
1976, are supplemented by enacting
new Sections 192.57 to 192.72 to read
as follows:
Section 192.57 Filing Net Profit
Taxes; Election to be Subject to Provisions of Chapter
(a) A taxpayer may elect to be
subject to Sections 192.57 to 192.72 of
the Codified Ordinances in lieu of

remainder of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
chapter, upon the taxpayer’s election, both of the following shall
apply:
(1) The state tax commissioner as
defined in section 718.01 of the
Revised Code shall serve as the sole
administrator of the municipal net
profit tax levied pursuant to this
Chapter for which the taxpayer as
defined in Section 192.58(c) of the
Codified Ordinances is liable for the
term of the election;
(2) The tax commissioner shall
administer the tax pursuant to sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised
Code, Sections 192.57 to 192.72 of the
Codified Ordinances, and any applicable provision of Chapter 5703. of
the Revised Code
(b)
(1) A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the first
day of the third month after the

The City Record
year by notifying the tax commissioner and the City, on a form prescribed by the tax commissioner.
(2)
A. The election, once made by the
taxpayer, applies to the taxable
year in which the election is made
and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the tax
commissioner and the City of its termination of the election.
B. A notification of termination
shall be made, on a form prescribed
by the tax commissioner, on or
before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
C. Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the taxpayer
is no longer subject to Sections
192.57 to 192.72 of the Codified Ordinances, and is instead subject to the
provisions set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
(c) The tax commissioner shall
enforce
and
administer
Sections
192.57 to 192.72 of the Codified Ordinances. In addition to any other
powers conferred upon the tax commissioner by law, the tax commissioner may:
(1) Prescribe all forms necessary
to administer those sections;
(2) Adopt such rules as the tax
commissioner finds necessary to
carry out those sections;
(3) Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out
the duties imposed upon the tax
commissioner by those sections.
(d) The tax commissioner shall
not be considered a tax administrator, as that term is defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
Section 192.06 of the City Codified
Ordinances.
Section 192.58 Definitions
If a term used in Sections 192.57
to 192.72 of the Codified Ordinances
that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United
States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Revised
Code and the use is not consistent,
then the use of the term in the laws
of the United States relating to federal income tax shall have control
over the use of the term in Title
LVII of the Revised Code, unless the
term is defined in Chapter 5703. of
the Revised Code, in which case the
definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference in this chapter
to
the
Internal
Revenue
Code
includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income
taxes. If a term is defined in both
this section and Section 192.06 of the
Codified Ordinances, the definition
in this section shall control for all
uses of that term in Sections 192.58
to 192.72 of the Codified Ordinances.

the Codified Ordinances, means a C
corporation’s federal taxable income
before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted

extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
(9) Deduct any net profit of a
pass-through entity owned directly
or indirectly by the taxpayer and
included in the taxpayer’s federal
taxable income unless an affiliated
group of corporations includes that
net profit in the group’s federal taxable income in accordance with division (e)(3)B. of Section 192.63 of the
Codified Ordinances.
(10) Add any loss incurred by a

February 14, 2018

in division (uu)(2)A. of Section
192.06 of the Codified Ordinances,
and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the election
described in division (w)(4)B. of
Section 192.06 of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income
under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except
guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder,

or former member, and amounts
paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder,
former
shareholder,
member, or former member shall not
be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (b) of this section shall be construed as allowing
the taxpayer to add or deduct any
amount more than once or shall be
construed as allowing any taxpayer
to deduct any amount paid to or
accrued for purposes of federal selfemployment tax.
(c) “Taxpayer” has the same
meaning as in division (uu) of Section 192.06 of the Codified Ordinances, except that “taxpayer” does

receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are
required to assume the role of a taxpayer.

year ending during the calendar
year, or fractional part thereof, upon

purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections 192.57 to 192.72 of
the Codified Ordinances is changed
accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax
purposes.
The
tax
commissioner
may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year for a
taxpayer that has had a change of
its taxable year for federal income
tax purposes, for a taxpayer that
has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as
the result of a change of ownership,
or for a new taxpayer that would
otherwise have no taxable year.

The City Record
(f) “Assessment” means a notice
of underpayment or nonpayment of

or profession in the City and that

in division (b) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession
conducted both within and without
the boundaries of the City shall be
considered as having a taxable situs
in the City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the average ratio of the
following:
(1) The average original cost of
the real property and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession in the City during the taxable
period to the average original cost
of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.

property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the
value of such property shall be

in the business or profession for services performed in the City to
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the same period
to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever the

taxes are not required to be withheld under Section 192.11 of the Codified Ordinances;
(3) Total gross receipts of the
business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in
the City to total gross receipts of
the business or profession during

(1) If the apportionment factors
described in division (a) of this section do not fairly represent the
extent of a taxpayer’s business
activity in the City, the taxpayer
may request, or the tax commissioner may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment
method involving one or more of the

17
filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in an
assessment issued within the period
prescribed by division (a) of Section
192.67 of the Codified Ordinances.
(3) The tax commissioner may
require a taxpayer to use an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (b)(1) of this
section only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the
period prescribed by division (a) of
Section 192.67 of the Codified Ordinances.
(c) As used in division (a)(2) of
this section, “wages, salaries, and
other compensation” includes only

customer, client, or patient.
(2) Any location at which a trial,
appeal,
hearing,
investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or
similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is
being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services
performed for, or on behalf of, the
employer or that the employee’s
presence at the location directly or
indirectly benefits the employer;
(3) Any other location, if the tax
commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to
perform the services at the other
location
in
lieu
of
a
location
described in division (c)(1) or (2)
of this section solely in order to
avoid or reduce the employer’s
municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a
determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the tax commissioner’s determination was unreasonable.
(d) For the purposes of division
(a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services
performed shall be sitused to the
City as follows:
(1) Gross receipts from the sale of
tangible personal property shall be

criteria:
A. The property is shipped to or
delivered within the City from a
stock of goods located within the
City.
B. The property is delivered within the City from a location outside
the City, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and
the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
(2) Gross receipts from the sale of
services shall be sitused to the City
to the extent that such services are
performed in the City.

18
(3) To the extent included in
income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the City
shall be sitused to the City.
(4) To the extent included in
income, gross receipts from rents
and royalties from real property
located in the City shall be sitused
to the City.
(5) Gross receipts from rents and
royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City
based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used
in the City.
(e) Commissions received by a
real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate shall be sitused to the
City in which the real estate is
located. Net profit reported by the
real estate agent or broker shall be
allocated to the City based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent
or broker received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate
located in the City to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
(f) If, in computing a taxpayer’s
adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with
respect to a stock option granted to
an employee, and if the employee is
not required to include in the
employee’s income any such amount
or a portion thereof because it is
exempted from taxation under the
Codified Ordinances by the City, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to the City. In no case shall
a taxpayer be required to add to its
net profit that was apportioned to
the City any amount other than the
amount upon which the employee
would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock
option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for
the purpose of making an adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer’s
net profit that was apportioned to
the City under this section.
(g) When calculating the ratios
described in division (a) of this section for the purposes of that division
or division (b) of this section, the
owner of a disregarded entity shall
include in the owner’s ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts
of such disregarded entity.

documents or other information.
B. A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically through
the Ohio business gateway or in
another manner as prescribed by the
tax commissioner shall either submit the documents required under
this division electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if
electronic submission is not available, mail the documents to the tax

income tax return is due, the commissioner shall grant the taxpayer’s
extension request.

is not an extension of the time to
pay any tax due unless the tax commissioner grants an extension of
that date.
(2) If the commissioner considers
it necessary in order to ensure payment of a tax imposed in accordance
with Section 192.03 of the Codified

(e) Each return required to be
filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person, including a tax return
preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to
the return. The return or instructions accompanying the return shall
indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or
other person concerning questions
that arise during the examination or
other review of the return and
authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the commissioner with information that is missing
from the return, to contact the commissioner for information about the
examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer’s refund or payments, and to
respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation
that

192.63
Consolidated
Returns
(a) As used in this section:
(1) “Affiliated group of corporations” means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if
such a group includes at least one
incumbent local exchange carrier
that is primarily engaged in the

any
incumbent
local

the Internal Revenue Code.
(3) “Consolidated federal taxable
income” means the consolidated taxable income of an affiliated group
of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated
federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. “Consolidated federal taxable income” does
not include income or loss of an
incumbent local exchange carrier
that is excluded from the affiliated
group under division (a)(1) of this
section.
(4) “Incumbent local exchange
carrier” has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
(5) “Local exchange telephone service” has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
(b)
(1) A taxpayer that is a member
of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject
to municipal income tax levied pursuant to this Chapter in that taxable
year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated
federal income tax return with
respect to that taxable year. The
election is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the initial election
unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal
law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent fiveyear period unless the taxpayer
elects to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division

receives permission from the tax
commissioner. The tax commissioner shall approve such a request for
good cause shown.
(2) An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or
before the fifteenth day of the
fourth month of the year following
the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return election period in
effect under division (b)(1) of this
section. The election to discontinue

of the Codified Ordinances, a valid
election made by the taxpayer under

203

19
division (b)(1) or (2) of Section
192.15 of the Codified Ordinances is
binding upon the tax commissioner
for the remainder of the five-year
period.
(5) When an election made under
Section 192.57 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under this section is binding upon the tax administrator for
the remainder of the five-year period.
(c) A taxpayer that is a member
of an affiliated group of corporations that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable
year shall file a consolidated tax
return for that taxable year if the
tax commissioner determines, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not
been conducted at arm’s length and
that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with
regard to allocation of net profits to
a municipal corporation. A taxpayer
that is required to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated tax return
for all subsequent taxable years
unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the
commissioner to file a separate
return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.

group of which the taxpayer is a
member.
(e)
(1) Except as otherwise provided
in divisions (e)(2), (3), and (4) of
this section, corporations that file a
consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted
federal
taxable
income, as defined in Section 192.58
of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting “consolidated federal taxable income” for “federal taxable
income” wherever “federal taxable
income” appears in that division and
by substituting “an affiliated group
of corporation’s” for “a C corporation’s” wherever “a C corporation’s”
appears in that division.
(2) No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment
otherwise
required
under division (b) of Section 192.58
of the Codified Ordinances to the
extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the
adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
(3) If the net profit or loss of a
pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its
ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by an
affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group’s
consolidated federal taxable income
for a taxable year, the corporation
filing a consolidated tax return
shall do one of the following with
respect to that pass-through entity’s
net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
A. Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the consolidated federal taxable income of
the affiliated group and, for the purpose of making the computations

20
required in Section 192.59 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net
profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or
loss is so excluded, the entity shall
be subject to taxation as a separate
taxpayer on the basis of the entity’s
net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated
group.
B. Include the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group and, for the purpose
of
making
the
computations
required in Section 192.59 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net
profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or
loss is so included, the entity shall
not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity’s net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
(4) If the net profit or loss of a
pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its
ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by an
affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group’s
consolidated federal taxable income
for a taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
A. The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity’s net profit
or loss from the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated
group and, for the purposes of making the computations required in
Section 192.59 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the passthrough entity in the computation of
the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
B. The pass-through entity shall
be subject to municipal income taxation as a separate taxpayer in
accordance with Sections 192.57 to
192.72 of the Codified Ordinances on
the basis of the entity’s net profits
that would otherwise be included in
the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
(f) Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
192.59 of the Codified Ordinances by
substituting “consolidated federal
taxable income attributable to” for
“net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in that section and
by substituting “affiliated group of
corporations” for “taxpayer” wherever “taxpayer” appears in that section.
(g) Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest,
penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
192.57 to 192.72 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the
Revised Code to the corporation, an
affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any portion
of the taxable year, or any one or
more members of such an affiliated
group.

The City Record
Section 192.64 Failure to Pay Tax
If a taxpayer that has made the
election allowed under Section 192.57
of the Codified Ordinances fails to
pay any tax as required under Sections 192.57 to 192.72 of the Codified
Ordinances, or any portion of that
tax, on or before the date prescribed
for its payment, interest shall be
assessed, collected, and paid, in the
same manner as the tax, upon such
unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47
of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is
paid or until the date an assessment
is issued under Section 192.67 of the
Codified
Ordinances,
whichever
occurs first.
Section 192.65 Declaration of Estimated Taxes
(a) As used in this section:
(1)
“Combined
tax
liability”
means the total amount of a taxpayer’s income tax liabilities to all
municipal corporations in this state
for a taxable year.
(2) “Estimated taxes” means the
amount that the taxpayer reasonably estimates to be the taxpayer’s
combined tax liability for the current taxable year.
(b)
(1) Except as provided in division
(b)(4) of this section, every taxpayer shall make a declaration of
estimated taxes for the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by
the tax commissioner, if the amount
payable as estimated taxes is at
least two hundred dollars.
(2) Except as provided in division
(b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than
twelve months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the
commissioner.
(3) The declaration of estimated
taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month
after the beginning of the taxable
year or on or before the fifteenth
day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for
the first time.
(4) The tax commissioner may
waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for
any class of taxpayers after finding
that the waiver is reasonable and
proper in view of administrative
costs and other factors.
(c) Each taxpayer shall file the
declaration of estimated taxes with,
and remit estimated taxes to, the
tax commissioner at the times and
in the amounts prescribed in division (c)(1) of this section. Remitted
taxes shall be made payable to the
treasurer of state.
(1) The required portion of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year that shall be paid through
estimated taxes shall be as follows:
A. On or before the fifteenth day
of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year;
B. On or before the fifteenth day
of the sixth month after the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable year;
C. On or before the fifteenth day
of the ninth month after the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven

204

February 14, 2018
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year;
D. On or before the fifteenth day
of the twelfth month of the taxable
year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
(2) If the taxpayer determines
that its declaration of estimated
taxes will not accurately reflect the
taxpayer’s tax liability for the taxable
year,
the
taxpayer
shall
increase or decrease, as appropriate,
its subsequent payments in equal
installments to result in a more
accurate
payment
of
estimated
taxes.
(3)
A. Each taxpayer shall report on
the declaration of estimated taxes
the portion of the remittance that
the taxpayer estimates that it owes
to each municipal corporation for
the taxable year.
B. Upon receiving a payment of
estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately
forward the payment to the treasurer of state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner
as in division (B) of section 718.85
of the Revised Code.
(d)
(1) In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount
determined at the rate per annum
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the
Revised Code upon the amount of
underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (e) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
A. For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount
of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
B. For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid
by the date prescribed for that payment;
C. For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount
of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
D. For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability,
less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment.
(2) The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated payment was required to be
made to the date on which the payment is made. For purposes of this
section, a payment of estimated
taxes on or before any payment date
shall be considered a payment of
any previous underpayment only to
the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
(3) All amounts collected under
this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections 192.57
to 192.72 of the Codified Ordinances
and shall be credited and distributed
to municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the
Revised Code.

February 14, 2018
(e) An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall
be due to reasonable cause and the
penalty imposed by this section
shall not be added to the taxes for
the taxable year if any of the following apply:
(1) The amount of estimated
taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax
liability for the current taxable
year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up
to the end of the month immediately preceding the month in which the
payment is due.
(2) The amount of estimated
taxes that were paid equals at least
one hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the
taxpayer for the preceding taxable
year, provided that the immediately
preceding taxable year reflected a
period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal income tax
return for that year.
Section 192.66 Additional Penalties
(a) In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections 192.57 to
192.72 of the Codified Ordinances or
Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code,
the following penalties shall apply:
(1) If a taxpayer required to file
a tax return under Sections 192.57 to
192.72 of the Codified Ordinances
fails to make and file the return
within the time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted
by the tax commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not
exceeding twenty-five dollars per
month or fraction of a month, for
each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date,
including extensions of the due
date, and the date on which the
return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this division
shall not exceed one hundred fifty
dollars.
(2) If a person required to file a
tax return electronically under Sections 192.57 to 192.72 of the Codified
Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a penalty not
to exceed the following:
A. For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the
return;
B. For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on
the return.
(3) If a taxpayer that has made
the election allowed under Section
192.57 of the Codified Ordinances
fails to timely pay an amount of tax
required to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a
penalty equal to fifteen per cent of
the amount not timely paid.
(4) If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections 192.57 to 192.72 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which the
substantial correctness of the return
may be judged or contains information that on its face indicates that
the return is substantially incorrect,
and the filing of the return in that
manner is due to a position that is
frivolous or a desire that is apparent from the return to delay or
impede the administration of Sections 192.57 to 192.72 of the Codified

The City Record
Ordinances, a penalty of up to five
hundred dollars may be imposed.
(5) If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting
or payment of the tax required to be
shown on any return required under
Sections 192.57 to 192.72 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be
imposed not exceeding the greater
of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
(6) If any person makes a false
or fraudulent claim for a refund
under Section 192.68 of the Codified
Ordinances,
a
penalty
may
be
imposed not exceeding the greater
of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division,
any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date
of the refund, may be assessed
under Section 192.67 of the Codified
Ordinances without regard to any
time limitation for the assessment
imposed by division (a) of that section.
(b) For purposes of this section,
the tax required to be shown on a
tax return shall be reduced by the
amount of any part of the tax paid
on or before the date, including any
extensions of the date, prescribed
for filing the return.
(c) Each penalty imposed under
this section shall be in addition to
any other penalty imposed under
this section. All or part of any
penalty imposed under this section
may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may adopt
rules governing the imposition and
abatement of such penalties.
(d) All amounts collected under
this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections 192.57
to 192.72 of the Codified Ordinances
and shall be credited and distributed
to municipal corporations in the
same proportion as the underlying
tax liability is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section 718.83 of the
Revised Code.
Section
192.67
Assessments
Against Taxpayer
(a) If any taxpayer required to
file a return under Sections 192.57 to
192.72 of the Codified Ordinances
fails to file the return within the
time prescribed, files an incorrect
return, or fails to remit the full
amount of the tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax
commissioner may make an assessment against the taxpayer for any
deficiency for the period for which
the return or tax is due, based upon
any information in the commissioner’s possession.
The tax commissioner shall not
make
or
issue
an
assessment
against a taxpayer more than three
years after the later of the date the
return subject to assessment was
required to be filed or the date the
return was filed. Such time limit
may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent
in writing to the extension. Any
such extension shall extend the
three-year time limit in Section
192.68 of the Codified Ordinances for
the same period of time. There shall
be no bar or limit to an assessment
against a taxpayer that fails to file

205

21
a return subject to assessment as
required by Sections 192.57 to 192.72
of the Codified Ordinances, or that
files a fraudulent return. The commissioner shall give the taxpayer
assessed
written
notice
of
the
assessment as provided in section
5703.37 of the Revised Code. With
the notice, the commissioner shall
provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a
hearing on the petition.
(b) Unless the taxpayer assessed
files with the tax commissioner
within sixty days after service of
the notice of assessment, either personally or by certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed
by the authorized agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of
the facts, the assessment becomes
final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state.
The petition shall indicate the taxpayer’s objections, but additional
objections may be raised in writing
if received by the commissioner
prior to the date shown on the final
determination. If the petition has
been properly filed, the commissioner
shall
proceed
under
section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
(c) After an assessment becomes
final, if any portion of the assessment
remains
unpaid,
including
accrued interest, a certified copy of
the tax commissioner’s entry making the assessment final may be
filed in the office of the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has an
office or place of business in this
state, the county in which the taxpayer’s statutory agent is located, or
Franklin county.
Immediately upon the filing of the
entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment against the taxpayer assessed
in the amount shown on the entry.
The judgment may be filed by the
clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled
“special judgments for municipal
income taxes,” and shall have the
same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply
to sales made under the judgment.
If the assessment is not paid in
its entirety within sixty days after
the day the assessment was issued,
the portion of the assessment consisting of tax due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed
by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for collection under section 131.02 of the
Revised
Code,
whichever
comes
first. If the unpaid portion of the
assessment is certified to the attorney general for collection, the entire
unpaid portion of the assessment
shall bear interest at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47
of the Revised Code from the date
of certification until the date it is
paid in its entirety. Interest shall be
paid in the same manner as the tax
and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
(d) All money collected under this
section shall be credited to the

22
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which the money is owed
based on the assessment issued
under this section.
(e)
If
the
tax
commissioner
believes that collection of the tax
will be jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection
of the tax are instituted without
delay, the commissioner may issue a
jeopardy assessment against the
taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the jeopardy assessment, the commissioner
shall file an entry with the clerk of
the court of common pleas in the
manner prescribed by division (c) of
this section. Notice of the jeopardy
assessment shall be served on the
taxpayer assessed or the taxpayer’s
legal representative in the manner
provided in section 5703.37 of the
Revised Code within five days of
the filing of the entry with the
clerk. The total amount assessed is
immediately
due
and
payable,
unless the taxpayer assessed files a
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (b) of this section and provides security in a form
satisfactory to the commissioner and
in an amount sufficient to satisfy
the unpaid balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the
assessment does not prejudice the
commissioner’s consideration of the
petition for reassessment.
(f) Notwithstanding the fact that
a petition for reassessment is pending, the taxpayer may pay all or a
portion of the assessment that is the
subject of the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
If upon final determination of the
petition an error in the assessment
is corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant
to a decision of the board of tax
appeals or any court to which the
determination or decision has been
appealed, so that the amount due
from the taxpayer under the corrected assessment is less than the
portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal
representative
a
refund
in
the
amount of the overpayment as provided by Section 192.68 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on
that amount as provided by that section.
Section 192.68 Refund Applications
(a) An application to refund to a
taxpayer the amount of taxes paid
on any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
192.57 to 192.72 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall
be filed with the tax commissioner
within three years after the date of
the illegal, erroneous, or excessive
payment of the tax, or within any
additional period allowed by division (a) of Section 192.67 of the Codified Ordinances. The application
shall be filed in the form prescribed
by the tax commissioner.
(b)
(1) On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner shall
determine the amount of refund to
which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based

The City Record
on the amount overpaid per return
or assessment. If the amount is
greater than ten dollars and not less
than that claimed, the commissioner
shall certify that amount to the
director of budget and management
and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund created in section 5703.052 of the
Revised Code. If the amount is
greater than ten dollars but less
than that claimed, the commissioner
shall proceed in accordance with
section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
(2) Upon issuance of a refund
under this section, the commissioner shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to
the taxpayer attributable to that
municipal corporation, which shall
be deducted from the municipal corporation’s next distribution under
section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
(c) Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section that is not issued within ninety days after such determination
shall bear interest at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47
of the Revised Code from the ninety-first day after such determination
until the day the refund is paid or
credited. On an illegal or erroneous
assessment, interest shall be paid at
that rate from the date of payment
on the illegal or erroneous assessment until the day the refund is
paid or credited.
Section 192.69 Amended Returns
(a) If any of the facts, figures,
computations,
or
attachments
required in an annual return filed
by a taxpayer that has made the
election allowed under Section 192.57
of the Codified Ordinances and used
to determine the tax due under Sections 192.57 to 192.72 of the Codified
Ordinances must be altered as the
result of an adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal income tax return,
whether initiated by the taxpayer or
the internal revenue service, and
such alteration affects the taxpayer’s tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner requires. The amended
return shall be filed not later than
sixty days after the adjustment is
agreed upon or finally determined
for federal income tax purposes or
after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement
or credit resulting therefrom, has
been assessed or paid, whichever
occurs first. If a taxpayer intends to
file an amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to amend
its type of return from a separate
return to a consolidated return,
based on the taxpayer’s consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended
return.
(b) In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any
combined additional tax due together with any penalty and interest
thereon.
An
amended
return
required by this section is a return
subject to assessment under Section
192.67 of the Codified Ordinances for
the purpose of assessing any additional tax due under this section,

206

February 14, 2018
together with any applicable penalty and interest. The amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return no longer
subject to assessment that are not
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal tax return.
(c) In the case of an overpayment,
an application for refund may be
filed under this division within the
sixty-day period prescribed for filing the amended return, even if that
period extends beyond the period
prescribed in Section 192.68 of the
Codified Ordinances, if the application
otherwise
conforms
to
the
requirements of that section. An
application filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments
resulting from alterations to only
those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual return that are affected,
either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal income tax return unless it is
also filed within the time prescribed
in Section 192.68 of the Codified
Ordinances. The application shall
not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal income tax return.
Section
192.70
Examination
of
Records and Other Documents and
Persons
(a) The tax commissioner, or any
authorized agent or employee thereof, may examine the books, papers,
records,
and
federal
and
state
income tax returns of any taxpayer
or other person that is subject to
Sections 192.57 to 192.72 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of
verifying the accuracy of any return
made or, if no return was filed, to
ascertain the tax due as required
under those sections. Upon written
request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject
to
this
section
is
required to furnish the opportunity
for the commissioner, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate
and examine such books, papers,
records,
and
federal
and
state
income tax returns at a reasonable
time and place designated in the
request.
(b) The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections 192.57
to 192.72 of the Codified Ordinances
shall be open to the tax commissioner’s inspection during business
hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the
end of the taxable year to which the
records or documents relate, unless
the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction within
that period, or by order requires
that they be kept longer. The commissioner may require any person,
by notice served on that person, to
keep such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show
whether or not that person is liable,
and the extent of such liability, for
the income tax levied by a municipal corporation.
(c) The tax commissioner may
examine under oath any person that

February 14, 2018
the
commissioner
reasonably
believes has knowledge concerning
any income that was or would have
been returned for taxation or any
transaction tending to affect such
income. The commissioner may, for
this purpose, compel any such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal income
tax returns in such person’s possession or control. The person may be
assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant,
bookkeeper,
or
other tax practitioner at any such
hearing or examination. This division does not authorize the practice
of law by a person who is not an
attorney.
(d) No person issued written
notice by the tax commissioner compelling attendance at a hearing or
examination or the production of
books, papers, records, or federal
income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
Section 192.71 Credits
(a) A credit, granted by resolution
or ordinance of the City pursuant to
Section 192.16 or 192.17 of the Codified Ordinances, shall be available
to a taxpayer that has made the
election allowed under Section 192.57
of the Codified Ordinances, against
the municipal corporation’s tax on
income. A municipal corporation
shall submit the following information to the tax commissioner on or

credit shall submit, with the taxpayer’s tax return, documentation
issued by the City granting the credit that confirms the eligibility of the
taxpayer for the credit, the amount
of the credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the tax year to
which the credit is to be applied.
(2) Such documentation shall be
provided in the form prescribed by
the tax commissioner.
(3) Nothing in this section shall
be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a
credit, to determine if a taxpayer
meets the conditions of a tax credit
agreement entered into by the City
and taxpayer under Section 192.16 or
192.17 of the Codified Ordinances,, or
to modify the terms or conditions of
any such existing agreement.

The City Record
of Section 192.60 of the Codified
Ordinances constitutes a separate
offense.

not be construed to prevent the City
from prosecuting any and all other
offenses that may apply.

of HB 49 is stayed or enjoined, that
the provisions adopted in Section 2
of this ordinance shall likewise be
stayed or ineffective.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
