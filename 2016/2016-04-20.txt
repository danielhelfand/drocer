amend Section 3 of Ordinance No.
1437-15, passed December 7, 2015,
relating to reallocating unused pre2015 HOME funds to the Housing
Trust Fund Program.
Whereas, under 24 CFR §92.500,
the City is required to commit their
HOME allocation within twentyfour months of HUD’s notification
that they have executed their
HOME
Investment
Partnership
Grant Agreements; and
Whereas, the twenty-four month
period ends on July 31, 2016; and
Whereas,
the
Repair-A-Home
(RAH) and Afford-A Home (AAH)
programs both carry prior year
grant balances; and
Whereas, the Senior Housing
Assistance Program (SHAP) was
budgeted with HOME funds, due to
its program design, is better tailored to use CDBG funds, and therefore, SHAP carries a grant balance
as well; and
Whereas, if pre-2015 HOME funds
are not committed by the July 31,
2016 deadline, 24 CFR §92.500 allows
HUD to reduce or recapture HOME
funds in the amount that are uncommitted prior to the deadline; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 3 of Ordinance No. 1437-15, passed December
7, 2015, is amended to read as follows:
Section 3. That the amount allocated for the contracts shall be

19 SF 690, and 14 SF 040, Request No.

Section 2. That Section 3 of Ordinance No 1437-15, passed December
7, 2015, is repealed.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

an estimated balance of $132,000,
which Cumberland will provide; and
Whereas, Cumberland will be contracting for the design and construction of the Restroom and Volleyball Courts Improvement, after
review by the appropriate City officials; and
Whereas, because the Restroom
and Volleyball Courts Improvement
will be City-owned, but maintained
by Cumberland, this Council authorizes payment for the design and
construction of the improvement to
