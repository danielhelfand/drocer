FIRST READING EMERGENCY 
RESOLUTION REFERRED 
Res. No. 515-16. 
By Council Member Kazy. 
An emergency resolution support- 
ing the Federal Railroad Administra- 
tion’s proposed ruling requiring that 
trains in the United States are operat- 
ed by a crew of no less than two peo- 
ple. 
Whereas, the safe operation of 
freight and passenger trains are vital 
to commerce in the United States; and 
Whereas, the Federal Railroad 
Administration (FRA) has published 
a notice of proposed rulemaking
regarding adequate staffing on
trains, a factor we believe is vital to
ensuring safe train operations; and 
Whereas, polling across America
shows overwhelming bi-partisan sup-
port of two-person crews, with 83 to 87 
percent of those polled in favor of 
mandating that trains be operated by 
a crew of at least two qualified indi- 
viduals; and 
Whereas, national studies show 
that a minimum of two on-board crew 
members are vital to operate a train 
safely and minimize the likelihood of 
train-related accidents; and 
Whereas, virtually all trains in 
North America are already operated 
by crews of at least two individuals, 
making the economic impact of this 
proposed rule minimal; and 
Whereas, the FRA agrees that, 
while advancements in automated 
technology such as Positive Train 
Control systems improve railroad 
safety, they are not a substitute for a 
train’s on-board crew members; and 
Whereas, this Council supports 
efforts to keep train operations safe 
in the state of Ohio and the entire 
country;     
Whereas, this resolution consti- 
tutes an emergency measure for the 
immediate preservation of public 
peace, property, health or safety, now, 
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. 
That this Council hereby
supports the Federal Railroad Admin- 
istration’s proposed ruling requiring 
that trains operated in the United 
States are operated by a crew of no 
less than two people. 
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council 
is directed to transmit copies of this 
resolution to Ralph Leichliter, Leg- 
islative Representative Local 284, 
Assistant State Legislative Director, 
Ohio State Legislative Board SMART- 
TD for filing with the Federal Rail- 
road Administration. 
Section 3. That this resolution is 
hereby declared to be an emergency 
measure and, provided it receives the 
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all 
the members elected to Council, it 
shall take effect and be in force imme- 
diately 
upon 
its 
adoption 
and 
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it 
shall take effect and be in force from 
and after the earliest period allowed

[End Column One]ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS 
AND ORDINANCES 
Res. No. 397-16. 
By Council Member Cimperman. 
An emergency resolution opposing 
the discontinuation of parts of the bus 
service along the #81 bus line by the 
Greater Cleveland Regional Transit 
Authority. 
Whereas, the Greater Cleveland
Regional 
Transit 
Authority
(GCRTA) lacks funding to maintain 
current service levels so is proposing 
a 4% service reduction starting in 
August 2016; and 
Whereas, proposed changes will 
impact bus route #81, travelling 
through the Tremont area of Cleve- 
land; and 
Whereas, GCRTA proposes can- 
celling service to Lakeview Terrace 
and limiting service to the West 7th 
stop on the #81 bus line; and 
Whereas, this will negatively 
impact the Lakeview Terrace commu- 
nity and create hardship for those res- 
idents by impeding their access to 
affordable transit; and 
Whereas, this resolution consti- 
tutes an emergency measure for the 
immediate preservation of public 
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore, 
Be it resolved by the Council of 
the City of Cleveland: 
Section 1. That this Council opposes 
the discontinuation of parts of the bus 
service along the #81 bus line by the 
Greater Cleveland Regional Transit 
Authority. 
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council 
is directed to transmit copies of this 
resolution to Joe Calabrese, Chief 
Executive Officer and General Man- 
ager, the Greater Cleveland Regional 
Transit Authority. 
Section 3. That this resolution is 
hereby declared to be an emergency 
measure and, provided it receives the 
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all 
the members elected to Council, it 
shall take effect and be in force imme-
diately 
upon 
its 
adoption 
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it 
shall take effect and be in force from 
and after the earliest period allowed
by law. 
Adopted April 18, 2016.
Effective April 20, 2016. 
Res. No. 441-16. 
By Council Member Zone. 
An emergency resolution urging 
the United States Senate to perform 
its constitutional duty by promptly 
scheduling a hearing and by holding 
a confirmation vote for Judge Mer- 
rick Garland to ensure that the vacan- 
cy on the Supreme Court is filled with- 
out undue and unnecessary delay so 
that the Supreme Court can effective- 
ly serve its essential constitutional
function as the final arbiter of the
law. 
Whereas, the Constitution of the 
United States provides that the Senate 
shall provide Advice and Consent for 
appointments to the Supreme Court of 
the United States; and 
Whereas, the Senate’s constitution- 
al duty to advise and consent on judi- 
cial nominees is one of its most impor- 
tant and solemn responsibilities; and 
Whereas, the Senate has confirmed 
more than a dozen Supreme Court jus- 
tices in presidential election years, 
including five in the last 100 years; 
and 
[End Column Two]Whereas, the Senate has confirmed
justices in presidential election years
in which the executive and legisla-
tive branches of government were
divided between two political parties,
including Justice Anthony Kennedy’s
confirmation in 1988; and
Whereas, the Senate Judiciary
Committee has never denied a
Supreme Court nominee a hearing
since it began holding public confir-
mation hearings; and
Whereas, if the Senate refuses to
consider a Supreme Court nominee
until after the next President is
sworn into office, it will result in the
longest Supreme Court vacancy
caused by Senate inaction since the
Civil War; and
Whereas, the President has nomi-
nated Merrick Garland, Chief Judge
of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit, who is
well-qualified and has more judicial
experience than any Supreme Court
nominee in history; and
Whereas, forcing the Supreme
Court to function with only eight jus-
tices 
risks 
creating 
numerous
instances in which the Court is evenly
divided on the outcome of a case, pre-
venting the Court from resolving con-
flicting interpretations of the Consti-
tution among different regions of the
Nation and thereby undermining the
Supreme Court’s role as the final
arbiter of the law; and
Whereas, every Supreme Court
nominee who was not withdrawn by
the President has received an up-or-
down vote within 125 days of Presi-
dent’s nomination announcement; and
Whereas, the Supreme Court vacan-
cy caused by the death of Justice
Antonin Scalia occurred on February
13, 2016, 269 days before the 2016 pres-
idential election, and since 1975, the
average number of days from nomina-
tion to confirmation vote for a
Supreme Court nominee has been 70
days; and
Whereas, this resolution consti-
and
tutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
urges the United States Senate to per-
form its constitutional duty by
promptly scheduling a hearing and by
holding a confirmation vote for Judge
Merrick Garland to ensure that the
vacancy on the Supreme Court is
filled without undue and unnecessary
delay so that the Supreme Court can
effectively serve its essential consti-
tutional function as the final arbiter
of the law.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to all members of the Unit-
ed States Senate and to President
Barack Obama.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force imme-
diately 
upon 
its 
adoption 
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
