Project Summary and Discussion
Terminal Tower was built in the
1930’s, and KD Tower City LLC, an
affiliate of KD Management plans
substantial renovation and adaptive
reuse, while preserving the historic
interior of the building. The developer proposes to convert floors 4

October 4, 2017
through 14 from office space to
approximately 260,000 SF of residential space. When complete, the
floors will have 304 units: 156 of
which will be 1-bedroom, 88 will be
deluxe units, and 61 will be 2-bedroom units. The developer will also
renovate some existing office space
to attract more tenants to the building. Lastly, the developer will make
improvements to the adjacent North
Park Garage.
The
Department
of
Economic
Development is requesting approval
to enter into a non-school Tax Increment Financing agreement with KD
Tower City LLC, or its designee, to
help the financial feasibility of the
project. The developer will make
PILOT payments to use for debt service. The renovation is estimated to
cost $101.7 million.
The additional housing proposed
with this project will provide much
needed supply to an area that is in
high demand for people looking to
live downtown—where occupancy
has soared to nearly 98%. Further,
housing
located
directly
above
downtown’s primary transit hub for
RTA provides access anywhere in
the city without the need for a car.
As young professionals and empty
nesters flock to downtown they are
sure to be attracted to this project
for the possibility of living among
the
many
amenities
downtown
offers while maintaining the ease of
access beyond downtown. The redevelopment is expected to be completed in fourth quarter of 2019.
Developer
KD Tower City LLC is an entity
of K&D Management. As Chief
Executive Officer of K&D, Douglas
Price has been involved in all facets
of the real estate industry for over
32 years, and in conjunction with
his partner, Karen M. Paganini, has
built the largest privately owned
and managed portfolio of multi-family properties in Northeast Ohio. The
K&D portfolio includes a number of
mixed-use
properties,
with
over
2,000,000 SF of commercial and retail
space including the Halle Building,
Leader Building, and Keith Building. The newest addition to the portfolio is the historic landmark of Terminal Tower, which K&D purchased
in 2016.
Proposed City Assistance:
The request to Cleveland City
Council is to authorize the Director
of Economic Development to enter
into a non-school Tax Increment
Finance (TIF) agreement with KD
Tower City LLC or its designee. The
TIF proceeds will be used for debt
payments associated with the project. This TIF agreement will be up
to 30 years in length.
Under
the
agreement,
parcels
acquired and re-conveyed to the
developer will be “TIFed” under section 5709.41 of the Ohio Revised
Code in consideration for the developer
agreeing
to
make
certain
improvements to those parcels, and
agreeing to make payments in lieu
of taxes (PILOT) equal to the taxes
that would have been paid for those
parcels but for the TIF. A portion
of the PILOT will be paid to the
Cleveland Municipal School District
in the amount the District would
have otherwise received but for the
TIF.

The City Record
Economic Impact
• Retain 25 full time equivalent
jobs at the project site
• Create an additional 30 full time
equivalent jobs at the project site
• Income tax is projected for residents moving into the residential
conversion portion of the redevelopment. Over the 30-year term of
the TIF, the project is expected
to generate approximately $16
million in income taxes for the
City (assumes 50% of the residents work in the City, and a 2%
annual growth in income).
• The project will also generate an
additional $5.4 million in property taxes for the schools over the
course of the TIF.

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 1210-17.
By Council Members Cummins and
Brady.
An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress and the
President to take immediate action
in their federal relief efforts to
assist the over 3.4 million United
States citizens who live in Puerto
Rico following the devastation of
Hurricane Maria on September 20,
2017; and further calling upon the
United States Congress to pass and
the President to sign legislation
allowing
an
economic
hardship
exemption for Puerto Rico from the
Merchant Marine Act of 1920, commonly known as the “Jones Act”.
On Wednesday September 20, 2017
Hurricane Maria, the worst storm to
hit Puerto Rico since 1928, made
landfall, taking out the electric and
telecommunication grid to over 3.4
million American citizens in Puerto
Rico and destroying countless structures in its path; 100% of residential
properties were left without electricity and running water; and
Whereas, according to the Associated Press, 1,360 of the island’s 1600
cell phone towers were destroyed by
Hurricane Maria and 85% of aboveground and underground phone and
internet cables were knocked out
due to the hurricane, making communication to and from the island
to family and friends practically
non-existent; and
Whereas, as of October 1, 2017,
55% of the Puerto Rican population
still does not have drinking water,
95% are still without electricity,
only 14% of cell towers are functioning and 721 of 1,100 gasoline stations are open; and
Whereas, to date Hurricane Maria
has killed 16 people in Puerto Rico
with the death toll likely to rise as
people lack medical care, drinking
water, medical supplies and cooling
units necessary to keep sick and
elderly in stable condition; and
Whereas, last week over 14,000
people were living in shelters, not
including the thousands of homeless
who have moved in with family;
80% of Puerto Rico’s crops have
been destroyed amounting to a $780

October 4, 2017
million dollar hit to the island’s
agriculture industry; and
Whereas, Hurricane Maria also
breached and destroyed a part of the
Guajataca Dam, endangering the
lives of 70,000 people living near the
dam in San Sebastian and Quebradillas; and
Whereas, the federal government
must make an immediate allocation
to FEMA for Puerto Rico, rather
than waiting for an analysis to allocate funding; further the Army
Corps of Engineers should take the
lead on the potential breach of the
Guajataca Dam and the U.S. Navy
should deploy ships to remove individuals who are sick and need
immediate health services; and
Whereas, the United States must
deploy U.S. military officer, logistics, communication and engineering
assets to help remove debris, clear
roads, and ensure that areas that
have been cut off receive the help
needed; U.S. military are needed to
help preserve law and order, ensure
relief supplies are delivered to those
most in need and protect Puerto
Ricans from crime and looting; and
Whereas, the federal government
must eliminate the formula for Puerto Rico’s federal ceiling on Medicaid
and replace it with a per capita cap
on par with those being proposed in
current health reform bills; the
Affordable Care Act block grant for
Puerto Rico will be depleted this
year and unless there is an influx
of funds, 900,000 Puerto Ricans who
qualified for funding before Hurricane Maria may no longer have
access to health care; and
Whereas, the U.S. Department of
Homeland
Security
should
take
steps to accelerate Puerto Rico’s
recovery
from
Hurricane
Maria
including, making the waiver of the
Jones Act a permanent exemption
and also exempting Puerto Rico
from
requirements
that
local
resources
match
federal
funds
expended by FEMA; and
Whereas, the Merchant Marine Act
of 1920, commonly known as the
“Jones Act,” requires that all shipping between United States (U.S.)
ports be conducted by U.S. built,
flagged, crewed and owned vessels;
and
Whereas, Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, is almost entirely reliant on
shipping for the receipt of goods,
therefore, the requirements of the
Jones Act affect the cost of nearly
every product Puerto Ricans consume; and
Whereas, according to the U.S.
Energy Information Administration,
per capita, Puerto Rican energy
usage is two-fifths less than that of
mainland Americans, yet their cost
of
electricity,
approximately
27
cents per kilo-watt hour, is twice the
average cost on the mainland; and
Whereas, a principal reason for
high energy costs is Puerto Rico’s
reliance on expensive petroleum to
generate electricity, due in part, to
the fact that there are only three
Jones Act carriers with a total of
six vessels, available on a limited
basis, that serve Puerto Rico’s bulk
cargo needs, such as petroleum and
grain; and
Whereas, limited availability of
Jones Act qualified bulk cargo carriers has obliged Puerto Rico to
import oil and gas from foreign
sources; and

The City Record
Whereas, even before Hurricane
Maria, Puerto Rico’s economy was
in great financial distress with an
unemployment rate of 12.6%, which
is more than twice the national
average, and a poverty rate nearly
double that of Mississippi, the poorest state in the Union; an International Monetary Fund report indicates that the Puerto Rican economy has seen virtually no growth
since 1996; Puerto Rico’s government has accrued a debt in excess
of $73 billion dollars; and
Whereas, there is wide consensus
that costs associated with the Jones
Act are a drag on the Puerto Rican
economy and hinder Puerto Rico’s
ability to grow its way out of this
economic crisis, made even worse by
Hurricane Maria; and
Whereas,
exemption
from
the
Jones Act is not without precedent
for United States territories as the
U.S. Virgin Islands are exempt from
the Jones Act; and
Whereas, failure to make Puerto
Rico’s waiver from the Jones Act a
permanent exemption will further
hinder the growth of Puerto Rico’s
economy as it struggles to recover
from the devastation of Hurricane
Maria, would constitute a dereliction
of the federal constitutional obligation to promote the general welfare
of its citizens-3.4 million of whom
inhabit the island of Puerto Ricoand represents a concern for all
Americans; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Congress and the
President to take immediate action
in their federal relief efforts to
assist the over 3.4 million United
States citizens who live in Puerto
Rico following the devastation of
Hurricane Maria on September 20,
2017; and further calls upon the
United States Congress to pass and
the President to sign legislation
allowing
an
economic
hardship
exemption for Puerto Rico from the
Merchant Marine Act of 1920, commonly known as the “Jones Act”.

members of the United States Congress.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1058-17.
By Council Members Cummins,
Brady, McCormack, Zone, J. Johnson, and Griffin.
An emergency resolution supporting
immigrant
youth,
including
those protected by DACA and supporting a federal law that would
continue the DACA program and
allow a path to citizenship for
Dreamers; opposing the withholding
of federal funding as a way to pressure local municipalities to enforce
federal
immigration
policies;
denouncing
anti-immigrant
bills
that promote racial profiling, discrimination
and
harassment
of
immigrant communities; and committing to working with the Jackson
administration
to
establish
strong policies to protect vulnerable
communities, especially immigrant
communities.
Whereas, nearly 800,000 young
people who came to the United
States as children have come forward, passed background checks,
and received permission to live and
work
in
America
through
the
Deferred
Action
for
Childhood
Arrivals
(DACA)
program;
with
DACA, they have advanced their
education, started small businesses,
and more fully established themselves as integral members of our
society; and
Whereas, despite his statements
that he will protect Dreamers, the
President has rescinded DACA effective about March 2018, calling upon
Congress to provide legislation to
manage Dreamers; as such, the fate
of
nearly
800,000
Dreamers
is
unknown; and
Whereas, the President has recently threatened to shut down the federal government in order to coerce
Congress to provide funds to build
a border wall; moreover, the Trump
administration continues to threaten
to withhold federal funding from
municipalities to pressure municipalities to enforce federal immigration law; and
Whereas, Immigration and Customs
Enforcement
(ICE)
has
renewed its effort to contract with
local sheriffs in an attempt to circumvent case law and facilitate
deportations; and
Whereas, the expansion of deportation and of local enforcement of
federal
immigration
laws
could
make everyone less safe because
when local law enforcement voluntarily cooperates with or works on
behalf of ICE, significant gaps in
trust and cooperation grow between
immigrant communities and local
police; some of these practices could
expose the city to liability for violations of individuals’ constitutional
rights; and
Whereas,
undue
collaboration
between local law enforcement and
ICE will cause fear and insecurity
among immigrants and make immigrants less likely to report crimes,
act as witnesses in criminal investigations and prosecutions, and provide intelligence to law enforcement; and
Whereas, the cooperation of the
City’s immigrant communities is
essential
to
prevent
and
solve

1699

17
crimes and maintain public order,
safety and security; further, community policing depends on trust
between all communities and facilitating deportations will harm the
City’s efforts at community policing;
and
Whereas, in May, 2017, the state
of Texas passed SB 4, an anti-immigrant bill that promotes racial profiling, discrimination and harassment of immigrant communities;
and
Whereas, elected officials across
Texas have stood up against SB 4
because it harms their ability to
keep their communities safe and
because it stands in direct conflict
to American values of respecting
and keeping safe all residents; and
Whereas, this Council understands
that government has a responsibility to ensure that every individual
and every family living in this country has the chance to succeed and
therefore denounces any anti-immigrant bill, like Texas’ SB 4; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that countries whose Temporary
Protected Status (TPS) designation
is set to expire be granted TPS
extensions so that eligible nationals
from these countries may continue
to receive work and travel authorization; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
values its ethnic, racial, linguistic,
and socio-economic diversity as a
source of strength and this Council
is committed to ensuring that all
our city’s residents live and pursue
their livelihoods in peace and prosperity; and
Whereas, this Council is committed to working with the mayor to
establish strong policies to protect
vulnerable communities, especially
immigrant communities, including
and to the extent legally possible:
limiting the co-optation of local
police by ICE; strong privacy protections limiting the sharing of confidential personal information with
federal agencies; adoption of clear
and transparent protocols for the
certification of U-Visas; vigorous
opposition to any government registry based on religion or national
origin; further this Council is committed to maintaining community
stakeholder
engagement
around
implementation of policies that preserve and protect our diverse and
inclusive city; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports immigrant youth, including
those protected by DACA and supports a federal law that would continue the DACA program and allow
a path to citizenship for Dreamers;
opposes the withholding of federal
funding as a way to pressure local
municipalities to enforce federal
immigration
policies;
denounces
anti-immigrant bills that promote
racial profiling, discrimination and
harassment of immigrant communities; and commits to working with
the Jackson administration to establish strong policies to protect vulnerable
communities,
especially
immigrant communities.

the City of Cleveland:

state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed

and
Whereas, the place for which the
