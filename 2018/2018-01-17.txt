Calendar No. 17-374: 16900 Lorain
Avenue (Ward 17)
Kamcor Realty, owner, and Brittany Bosch, prospective tenant, propose to establish tattooing use in a
C2 Local Retail Business District.
The owner appeals for relief from
the strict application of Section
343.01(b) which states that a Tattooing establishment is not permitted in a Local Retail Business District but is first permitted in a General Retail Business District per Section 343.11(b)(2)(P), and even when
in the district must be at least 1,000
feet from a residential district per
Section 347.12(b)(2), and from another tattooing establishment per Section 347.12(b)(3). The proposed use
abuts a residential district and is
within 1,000 feet of another tattoo
use application seeking a zoning
variance at 17134 Lorain Avenue.
