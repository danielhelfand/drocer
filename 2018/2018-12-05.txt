“Section 161.05
Regulation of
Environmental Changes; Certificate
of Appropriateness
No person owning, renting or occupying property which has been designated a landmark or which is situated in a designated landmark district shall make any environmental
change in such property unless a
certificate of appropriateness has
been previously issued by the Commission with respect to such environmental change. The following
procedures shall apply to all alterations, demolitions, removals or constructions of such property in the
City:
(a) Any application to the Division Department of Building and
Housing for a building permit for
an environmental change shall also
be deemed an application for a certificate of appropriateness, and shall
be forwarded to the Commission,
together with copies of all detailed
plans, designs, elevations, specifications and documents relating thereto,
and,
for
any
environmental
change on one (1) or more acres of
land, and for any environmental
change to an apartment, townhome
or condominium of four (4) or more
units situated on any size parcel of
land, a copy of a Tree Preservation
Plan meeting the requirements set
forth in Section 341.051, within seven
(7) days after receipt thereof of the
application. An application for a certificate of appropriateness may be
filed by the applicant directly with
the Commission at the same time
that an application for a building
permit is filed or in lieu of filing
for a building permit, if no building
permit is required for the proposed
environmental change.
The Commissioner of Park Maintenance and
Properties
or
a
designee
shall
review any Tree Preservation Plan
and shall notify the Director of
Building and Housing of approval
or disapproval as set forth in Section 341.051.
The general requirements of tree preservation in Section
341.052 shall apply to any person
seeking to make an environmental
change on one (1) or more acres of
land, and to any person seeking to
make an environmental change to
an apartment, townhome or condominium of four (4) or more units situated on any size parcel of land.
(b) The Commission shall evaluate
applications
to
determine
whether or not the environmental
change proposed by the applicant
will adversely affect any significant
historical or aesthetic feature of the
property and to determine whether
or not the environmental change
proposed by the applicant is consistent with the spirit and purposes of
this chapter.
(1) In evaluating applications for
alterations or construction of property, the Commission shall consider
the following standards created by
the U.S. Department of the Interior:
A. A property shall be used for its
historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal
change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and
environment;

The City Record
B. The historic character of a
property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic
materials or alternation of features
and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided;
C. Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its
time, place, and use. Changes that
create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural
elements from other buildings, shall
not be undertaken;
D. Most properties change over
time;
those
changes
that
have
acquired historic significance in
their own right shall be retained
and preserved;
E. Distinctive features, finishes,
and
construction
techniques
or
examples
of
craftsmanship
that
characterize a property shall be preserved;
F. Deteriorated historic features
shall
be
repaired
rather
than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature
shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities
and,
where
possible,
materials.
Replacement of missing features
shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence;
G. Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that
cause damage to historic materials
shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate,
shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible;
H.
Significant
archaeological
resources affected by a project shall
be protected and preserved. If such
resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken;
I. New additions, exterior, alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials
that characterize the property. The
new work shall be differentiated
from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale,
and architectural features to protect
the historic integrity of the property and its environment; and
J. New additions and adjacent or
related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that
if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment
would be unimpaired.
(2) In evaluating applications for
demolition or removal of property,
the Commission shall consider the
following standards:
A. The architectural and historic
significance of the subject building
or structure;
B. The significance of the building or structure in contributing to
the architectural or historic character of its environs;
C. In the case of a request to move
a building or other structure, the
relationship between the location of
the subject building or structure and
its overall significance;
D. The present and potential economic viability of the subject building or structure, given its physical
condition and marketability;
E. If the demolition will remedy
conditions imminently dangerous to
life, health, or property, as determined in writing by the Division
Department of Building and Housing, the Division of Fire or the
Department of Public Health; and

2064

December 5, 2018
F. The appropriateness of the proposed new structure or use and its
impact on the surrounding community.
(c) If the Commission finds that
the environmental change proposed
by the applicant will not adversely
affect any significant historical or
aesthetic feature of the property and
is appropriate and consistent with
the spirit and purposes of this chapter, or will remedy conditions imminently dangerous to life, health or
property, as determined in writing
Department
of
by
the
Division
Building and Housing or the Division of Fire or the Department of
Public Health, then the Commission
shall issue a certificate of appropriateness.
(d) If the Commission finds that
the environmental change proposed
by the applicant will adversely
affect any significant historical or
aesthetic feature of the property or
is inappropriate or inconsistent with
the spirit and purposes of this chapter, the Commission may either deny
the application or delay action on
the application. Any decision to
delay action on the application shall
be by mutual agreement of the Commission and the applicant and shall
be for a period not to exceed six (6)
months. During the delay period, the
Commission shall conduct further
investigation with regard to the proposed environmental change, conduct negotiations with the applicant
and any other party in an effort to
find a means of preserving the property, or explore alternatives to the
proposed environmental change. The
Commission may also investigate
the feasibility of all available ways
and
means
of
preserving
the
improvement, including without limitation, inducing by contract or
other consideration the creation of
covenants restricting the use of
property, leasing and subleasing the
property for the purposes of preservation and acquiring by eminent
domain or contract or conveyance
all or any part of or interest in the
property.

Res. No. 1418-18.
By Council Members Conwell, Kelley, J. Jones, B. Jones, Bishop,
McCormack,
Johnson,
Cleveland,
Griffin, Polensek, Hairston, Brady,
Brancatelli, Santana, Zone, Kazy,
and Keane.
An emergency resolution strongly
opposing H.B 228, the “stand your
ground” bill.
Whereas, on November 14, 2018,
the Ohio House passed H.B. 228 a
controversial bill that loosens gun
safety standards and expands the
locations at which a person has no
duty to retreat before using force
under both civil and criminal law;
and
Whereas, H.B. 228 shifts the burden to the state to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that a person did
not use force in self-defense; and
Whereas, H.B. 228 was amended to
modify the state’s preemption of
local firearm regulations by preempting municipalities from enacting any kind of firearm restriction,
even if that restriction does not contradict state law; and
Whereas, H.B. 228 was further
amended to allow any citizen who
feels as though a city or village has
infringed on their 2d Amendment
rights to sue the city; if the city is
found guilty, it must pay damages
to that citizen; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that, by removing the duty to
retreat, H.B. 228 makes our communities less safe because the bill
encourages violence instead of urging people to try to avoid violence;
and
Whereas, the bill comes at a time
of unprecedented gun violence in
this country: there have been 307
mass shootings in 311 days; and
Whereas, Ohio students, parents,
families and law enforcement have
asked Ohio legislators to enact common sense gun safety laws; in
response, Ohio House Democrats
offered
a
“red
flag”
gun-safety
amendment - the same measure

22
introduced by Governor John Kasich
in March, 2018 - but the amendment
was defeated largely on party lines;
and
Whereas, this Council supports
those Ohio state lawmakers that
voted against H.B. 228 and we especially support State Representative
Stephanie Howse in her attempt to
voice the impact that “stand your
ground” legislation has had on
minority communities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly opposes H.B 228, the “stand
your ground” bill.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit a copy of
this resolution to Governor John
Kasich and to all members of the
Ohio legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted November 26, 2018.
Effective November 28, 2018.

Res. No. 1460-18.
By Council Member Conwell.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of location of a
C2 and C2X Liquor Permit to 10933

Ohio 44106, Permit Number 6548448;
and
Whereas, the granting of this

Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and

The City Record
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.

must be received by the Superintendent of Liquor Control within 30

Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two
copies of a letter requesting that the
hearing be held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
