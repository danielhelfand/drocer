Avenue) (Ward 3)
H5 Cleveland LLC, owner, proposes to display a 5,440 square foot billboard/wall mural in a C3 SemiIndustry District and in the Central
Business
District.
The
owner
appeals for relief from the strict
application of the following sections
of the Cleveland Codified Ordinances:
1.
Section
350.03(e)(1)
which
states that a “billboard” is defined

July 19, 2017

as a sign directing attention to a
specific business, product, service,
entertainment activity or other commercial activity sold, offered or conducted elsewhere than upon the lot
on which the sign is located.
2. Section 350.03 which states that
a “wall mural” is defined as a sign
that displays high resolution static
or electronic graphic or photographic images, including decorative art
and art used in commerce, placed on
an unsightly wall of a building, or
unsightly roof surface generally
parallel to the building wall surface.
A wall mural may display words in
accordance with Section 350.161 and
otherwise shall comply with Section
350.161. A wall mural may depict or
direct attention to a specific business, product, service, entertainment
activity, or other activity. Wall
murals shall not be deemed billboards or wall signs for purposes of
Chapters 350 and 341 of this Zoning
Code and Chapters 161, 303, 3113,
and 317 of the Codified Ordinances.
3. Section 350.10(a) which states
that billboards shall be permitted
only in General Industry and Unrestricted Industry Districts.
4. Section 350.10(c) which states
that billboards sign panels shall not
exceed eight hundred and twenty
(820) square feet in area.
5. Section 350.161(g)(2)(3) which
states that exclusive of legal nonconforming wall murals or wall
signs, no more than six (6) wall
murals authorized by this section
may be displayed simultaneously
within the Central Business District
or the portion of the Flats Oxbow
Business Revitalization District that
is North of the Detroit Superior
Bridge and east of the Cuyahoga
River. 6 wall murals are already
currently
being
displayed.
Wall
murals design standards are subject
to City Planning review per section
350.161(g)(1)(c).
6. Section 350.161(h) City Planning
Commission has determined that the
sign does not meet the standards of
a “wall mural” and is classified as
a billboard. (Filed May 1, 2017 - No
Testimony)
The case was dismissed on July
10, 2017 due to the appellant’s
absence; the case was reinstated as
the appellant claimed he did not
receive the notice. The appellant
missed the hearing. First postponement made at the request of the City
Planning Commission for further
review and public meeting.

Company Background
The applicant for this proposed HUD 108 loan will be Hemingway Development LLC and/or designee (“Developer”). The
Developer has spent the past several years redeveloping formerly vacant and underutilized sites in the Health-Tech
Corridor of the MidTown neighborhood in Cleveland, including the development of three buildings at MidTown Tech
Park and the Agora Building. The principals of Hemingway Development LLC are Fred Geis, James Doyle, and Michael
Panzica.
Project Summary
Tax Increment Financing will support the development of a new 60,000 SF grocery store located at the intersection of
E. 63rd and Chester for Dave’s Supermarkets. Dave’s Supermarkets is a family-owned and operated supermarket chain
founded in the City of Cleveland in 1932. The site is currently a vacant lot that was formerly the Hattenbach building. The
proposed one-story building will include approximately 50,000 square feet for the grocery store and approximately 10,000
square feet of mezzanine space for a pharmacy, bank, and neighborhood gathering space. The total development cost for
the project is approximately $16.6 million. City financing is required in order to lower the cost of occupancy to ensure the
project’s long-term success. The project has also applied for and received a pre-commitment for approximately $4M
allocation of New Market Tax Credits (NMTC).
This new construction supermarket will be part of Hemingway Development’s Link59 campus and will be located across
the street from University Hospitals’ new Rainbow Center for Women and Children, an ambulatory care center. Directly
on the HealthLine, the grocery store will provide residents access to fresh, healthy and affordable food. Utilizing a grant
from US Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), local residents that are patients of the Rainbow Center will
receive healthy food “prescriptions” from physicians and other care providers for redemption at the supermarket. The
HHS grant will also allow the supermarket to provide cooking classes and seminars to create awareness around the
benefits of healthy food choices and nutritional education. WIC, SNAP and other subsidies will be accepted in order to
make the purchase of healthy food choices affordable.
Proposed City Assistance
• This ordinance will authorize the Director of Economic Development to enter into a 30-year non-school Tax Increment
Finance (TIF) agreement with Hemingway Development or its designee. The City will declare certain improvements
with respect to the project to be a public purpose and exempt 100% of the improvements from real property taxes. The
TIF proceeds will be on all non-abated, non-school portion of real estate taxes for the first 10 years and will capture
all non-school real estate taxes in the remaining 20 years.

• The developer agrees to make certain improvements to those parcels and make payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTs)
equal to the taxes that would have been paid for those parcels but for the TIF. A portion of the PILOTs will be paid
to the Cleveland Municipal School District in the amount the District would have otherwise received but for the TIF.
The balance of the PILOTs will be utilized to fund eligible project costs and project debt. The Developer will be
responsible for any shortfall of PILOT payments for project costs.
