(“Engineer”) for professional engineering consulting services necessary for the Pavement Management

Whereas, under the authority of
Resolution No. 493-17, adopted on
September 27, 2017, the City entered
into a first modification to Contract
No. PS2015-210 with Michael Baker
International, Inc. for additional

obtain the first one-third (1/3) portion of pavement condition surveys
for determining resurfacing cycles
and capital improvements and integrating the pavement management
data into the City’s GIS and Cityworks program, for an amount of
$196,336, thereby increasing the total
compensation under the contract to
$796,099.
Whereas, the City requires additional engineering services necessary to obtain the second one-third
(1/3) portion of pavement condition
surveys for determining resurfacing
cycles and capital improvements;
and
Whereas, the Engineer has proposed by its September 26, 2017 letter to perform the above-mentioned
additional services for an amount

Be it resolved by the Board of
Control of the City of Cleveland that
the Director of Capital Projects is
authorized to enter into a second
modification to Contract No. PS2015210 with Michael Baker International, Inc., in accordance with its proposal dated September 26, 2017, for
the aforementioned additional engineering services necessary to provide the second one-third (1/3) portion of pavement condition surveys

By Director Spronz.
Whereas, by Board of Control Resolution No. 180-18, adopted May 2,
2018, under the authority of Ordinance No. 1162-17, passed by the

4, 2017, Vandra Brothers Construction,

the amount of $2,347,152.36, for the
Division of Engineering and Construction, Mayor’s Office of Capital
Projects; and
Whereas, upon the Office of Equal
Opportunity’s review of its evaluation of bids received for the Project,
it was determined that a CSB bid
discount
had
been
improperly
applied to Vandra Brothers Construction, Inc.’s bid under Section
187.03, Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976 and that after proper application of bid discounts for
comparison purposes, Vandra was
not the lowest responsible bidder for
the Project; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Board of
Control of the City of Cleveland that
Resolution No. 180-18, adopted by
this Board on May 2, 2018, affirming
and approving Vandra Brothers Construction, Inc. as the lowest responsible bidder for the Harvard Avenue

Project Summary and Discussion
On August 31, 2017 the Department
of
Economic
Development
issued a RFP for Mixed-Use development at the northwest corner of
E. 105th Street and Ashbury Avenue.
This development will be the first
mixed-use development supported by
a MNTI program and serve as a
starting point to connect Uptown
and Historic Wade Park to Circle
North and the rest of the Glenville
neighborhood. E. 105th Street is a
significant transit corridor and an
excellent opportunity to highlight
the community, its residents, and
local entrepreneurs.
The
Finch
Group
proposes
a
mixed use, mixed income building
over an eight parcel vacant site at
the northwest corner of E. 105th
Street and Ashbury Avenue. The
development project includes:
• 9,200 SF of co-working space for
entrepreneurs
• 4,300 SF of space reserved for a
Retail Incubator to be master
leased by Cleveland Citywide
Development Corporation
• 42,000 SF of 1- and 2-bedroom
apartment space. Rent structure
complies with City’s request for
20% of units to be lease to residents whose incomes fall within 80% of AMI
• Approximately 51 one-bedroom
apartments (17 per floor)
• Approximately 12 two-bedroom
apartments (4 per floor)
• Amenities:
approximately
63
parking
spaces,
bike-share
racks, and balconies
The
Department
of
Economic
Development is requesting approval
to enter into a non-school Tax Increment Financing agreement with The
Finch Group, or its designee, to help
the financial feasibility of the project.
The
developer
will
make
PILOT payments to use for debt service. The project is estimated to cost
$14 million and expected to be completed in June of 2019.
Developer
The Finch Group was founded in
Boston in 1981 before relocating to
Boca Raton, Florida in 1997. They
have been involved in the development and operation of over 60 properties. As of September 2017, TFG
owns and/or operates: 2,052 multifamily units (with 70 units currently
in
development),
and
25,000
square feet of retail space in Cleveland, OH (with 7,000 square feet currently in development). They have

also established an impressive track
record by applying their extensive
experience in evaluating, developing, rehabilitating, marketing, and
managing everything from affordable
multi-family
residential
to
mixed-use properties.
For this development, TFG is
working with City Architecture Inc.
and Ozanne Construction Company.
Proposed City Assistance:
The request to Cleveland City
Council is to authorize the Director
of Economic Development to enter
into a non-school Tax Increment
Finance (TIF) agreement with The
Finch Group or its designee. The
TIF proceeds will be used for debt
payments associated with the project. This TIF agreement will be up
to 30 years in length.
Under the agreement, the parcels
will
be
“TIFed”
under
section
5709.41 of the Ohio Revised Code in
consideration
for
the
developer
agreeing to make certain improvements to those parcels, and agreeing to make payments in lieu of
taxes (PILOT) equal to the taxes
that would have been paid for those
parcels but for the TIF. A portion
of the PILOT will be paid to the
Cleveland Municipal School District
in the amount the District would
have otherwise received but for the
TIF.
