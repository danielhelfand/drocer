ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1245-18.
By Council Member J. Jones.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of
a C1 Liquor Permit to 3895 Lee
Road.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Division of Liquor Control of an application for the transfer of ownership of a C1 Liquor Permit from Socotra, Inc., DBA Food
Plus, 3895 Lee Road, Cleveland, Ohio
44128, Permit Number 8352307 to
Quick Lee, LLC, DBA Food Plus,
3895 Lee Road, Cleveland, Ohio
44128, Permit Number 7140205; and
Whereas, , the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Superintendent of Liquor Control within 30
days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to the transfer of ownership of a C1 Liquor Permit from Socotra, Inc., DBA Food
Plus, 3895 Lee Road, Cleveland, Ohio
44128, Permit Number 8352307 to

1763

25
Quick Lee, LLC, DBA Food Plus,
3895 Lee Road, Cleveland, Ohio
44128, Permit Number 7140205; and
requests
the
Superintendent
of
Liquor Control to set a hearing for
said application in accordance with
provisions of Section 4303.26 of the
Revised Code of Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two
copies of a letter requesting that the
hearing be held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 8, 2018.
Effective October 10, 2018.

Res. No. 1246-18.
By Council Members Brady, Jones,
J. Jones, Bishop, McCormack, Johnson, Cleveland, Griffin, Polensek,
Conwell, Hairston, Brancatelli, Kelley,
Santana,
Zone,
Kazy,
and
Keane.
An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Postal Service to expand
and enhance existing services such
as check cashing and international
money transfers, and to take necessary steps towards designing and
implementing additional financial
services.
Whereas, an astounding one in
four U.S. households (26.9%) is at
least partially outside the financial
mainstream, or underserved by traditional banks, according to a 2015
survey by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and
Whereas, those underserved by
traditional banks must rely on highcost and often predatory “alternative” financial services including
payday loans and check-cashing services,
resulting
in
underserved
households with an average annual
income of $25,000 spending an average of $2,400 per year on interest
and fees; and
Whereas, access to financial services is key to ensuring economic
and social opportunity for lowincome Americans, a vital priority
at a time of growing inequality in
our nation; and
Whereas, large banks have closed
branches in low-income communities
(where the largest number of underserved Americans reside); and
Whereas, the U.S. Postal Service
operates more than 33,000 retail
locations nationwide, many of which
are located in “bank deserts” (59
percent of post offices are in zip
codes with either zero banks or only
one bank branch), including 22 locations in Cleveland; and
Whereas, the U.S. Postal Service
has a mandate to serve all Americans, regardless of geography, at
affordable and uniform pricing; and
has
a
skilled
workforce
which
processes more than 286,000 money
orders every day; therefore, the
Postal Service has the infrastructure
to provide much-needed financial
services;

26
Whereas, worldwide, 1.5 billion
people receive some financial services through their postal service
and the U.S. Post Office Department
successfully offered financial services, including savings accounts,
for more than 50 years from 19111967; and
Whereas, the Postal Service is
consistently rated one of the most
trusted institutions and enjoys a
much higher level of confidence
from the public than do banks and
payday lenders; and
Whereas,
the
USPS
Office
of
Inspector General asserts that the
Postal Service can act now to provide
consumers
with
affordable
financial services, by expanding and
enhancing services including money
orders
and
international
money
transfers, and introducing new services such as check-cashing, bill
pay, and no-fee ATMS, and can do
so under current legal and regulatory authority; and
Whereas, providing these services
would strengthen our national treasure, the public Postal Service; and
Whereas, the U.S. Conference of
Mayors endorsed postal banking in
2014, and the communities of Lakewood, Brookpark, Fairview Park,
and Berea join Cleveland in adopting resolutions;
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the U.S. Postal Service to expand
and enhance existing services such
as check cashing and international
money transfers, and to take necessary steps towards designing and
implementing additional financial
services.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to send copies of this
resolution to the Campaign for
Postal Banking.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 8, 2018.
Effective October 10, 2018.

Ord. No. 497-18.
By Council Members Cleveland
and
Kelley
(by
departmental
request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Port Control to
enter into one or more contracts

American Airlines, Inc., to purchase
