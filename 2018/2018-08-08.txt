contain a provision that provides that the division of monies received when vehicles are salvaged shall be as
follows: the towing firm that impounded the vehicle shall be paid 30% of the salvage proceeds. The storage

to any vehicle that appears on the list of vehicles eligible to be salvaged, commonly known as the “junk list”,
issued after execution of a contract.

that are impounded under the authority of these Codified Ordinances, other than vehicles subject to forfeiture
under Chapter 2933 of the Revised Code where the disposition of the vehicle is governed by that chapter, and
that are unclaimed or abandoned and authorized to be disposed of under Chapter 4513 of the Revised Code or
other applicable law. The provisions of this section do not limit the authority of the Director of Public Safety to dispose of such vehicles under any contract that the Director may have entered into with motor vehicle
salvage dealers or scrap metal processing facilities under the authority of division (a)(3) of section 135.42 for
the disposal of such vehicles.
“(b) If a vehicle is auctioned under the authority of this section, then the proceeds of the auction shall be
deposited in an agency fund. The proceeds of the auction shall be disbursed from the agency fund in the following priority: the towing firm that impounded the vehicle shall be paid first, in the amount authorized for
its services in these Codified Ordinances, up to the amount of the proceeds obtained. The storage company
shall be paid next, in the amount authorized for its services in these Codified Ordinances, for storage for the
number of days that the vehicle was stored or 30 days, whichever is less, up to the amount of proceeds remaining after the towing firm is paid. Any other costs required to be paid by the City in connection with the auction shall be paid next, up to the amount of the proceeds remaining after the towing and storage firms are
paid as provided in this division. Any remaining funds shall be paid to the credit of the general fund.”
E. Process Tows.
The Division of Police shall pay the costs of towing any non-commercial or commercial vehicle in any case
in which the vehicle was impounded for processing by the Division of Police and the person reclaiming the
vehicle is the victim of a crime and is not liable for the towing fees under the Codified Ordinances.
29. In the event that the City elects to take ownership of an unclaimed motor vehicle for purposes other than
disposal of the vehicle, Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of fees otherwise chargeable.
