Whereas,
Evergreen
National

its obligations as surety on Utilicon’s performance bond under City

to Terrace, subject to and conditioned upon the City’s prior consent
to the aforementioned assignment

intends, as of the effective date of
an
assignment
and

agreement between them, subject to
the City’s prior consent, to assume
the contract with respect to Utilicon’s remaining obligations and liabilities under it to install up to

the assignment and the assumption,
respectively.
Be it further resolved that the

to do all things necessary and
appropriate to effect the consent to
