1756

November 30, 2016
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic Development to enter into an Enterprise
Zone Agreement with HEC Properties, LLC, or its designee, to provide
for tax abatement for certain real
property improvements at 2700 East
55th Street in the Cleveland Area
Enterprise Zone.
Whereas, by letter dated October
7, 2016, the City provided the Cleveland Metropolitan School District
(“CMSD”) with a notice of proposed
tax exemptions required by the
Revised Code; and
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 94895, passed June 19, 1995, this Council designated an area, which is in
the City of Cleveland and described
in File No. 948-95-A, as the Cleveland
Area Enterprise Zone (the “Zone”)
under Chapter 5709 of the Revised
Code; and
Whereas, under Ordinance No.
1568-14, passed December 8, 2014,
this Council changed the maximum
term of tax abatements from ten to
fifteen years, as now allowed under
Ohio law; and
Whereas, in August, 1995, the
Director of Development of the State
of Ohio determined that the Zone
contains
the
characteristics
described in division (A) of Section
5709.61 of the Revised Code and certified the area as an “Urban Jobs
and Enterprise Zone” under Chapter
5709 of the Revised Code; and
Whereas, HEC Properties, LLC, or
its designee (the “Enterprise”) has
proposed to renovate their new distribution facility located at 2700
East 55th Street in the Cleveland
Area Enterprise Zone; and
Whereas, the Enterprise has certified to the City that it would be
at a competitive disadvantage operating at this location if taxes on certain real property improvements
were not abated; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, safety, property, and welfare and that its enactment is a necessary prerequisite to
providing immediate assistance to
create and preserve job opportunities and advance and promote commercial and economic development
in the City of Cleveland, and the
assistance is immediately necessary
or jobs will be lost; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
approves the application of the
Enterprise for enterprise zone incentives on the basis that the Enterprise
is
qualified
by
financial
responsibility and business experience to create and preserve employment opportunities in the Cleveland
Area
Enterprise
Zone
and
to
improve the economic climate of the
City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Director of
Economic Development is authorized
to enter into an Enterprise Zone
Agreement with the Enterprise to
provide for a 10-year, sixty percent
(60%) tax abatement for certain real
property improvements commencing
the first year for which the real
property improvements would first be
taxable were that property not
exempted
from
taxation;
the
abatement shall be subject to annual
review of the Tax Incentive Review
Council.

November 30, 2016
Section 3. That the terms of the tax
abatement shall be in accordance with
the terms in the Summary contained in
File No. 1412-16-A. These terms shall
not be amended, nor shall the tax
abatement
be
assignable
or
transferable to any entity, without the
prior legislative authorization by
Cleveland City Council.
Section 4. That the Director of
Economic Development is authorized
to charge and accept fees in an
amount not to exceed the maximum
allowable under Chapter 5709 of the
Revised Code and the funds are
appropriated for the purposes listed in
Chapter 5709 of the Revised Code. The
fees shall be deposited to and
expended from Fund No. 17 SF 305.

The City Record
Section 5. That the contract and
other appropriate documents needed
to complete the transaction authorized
by this legislation shall be prepared
by the Director of Law.
Section
6.
That
any
contract
authorized by this legislation must
require the recipient of financial
assistance to work with, and/or cause
their Tenants to work with, The
Workforce Investment Board for
Workforce Area No. 3 to identify and
solicit qualified candidates for job
opportunities related to the City’s
contracts. The identification process
shall place special emphasis on the
hard to employ, including people who
are disabled and people who have
been convicted of or who have pled

5
guilty to a criminal offense which is
unrelated to the duties of the job
opportunity.
Section 7. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and,
provided
it
receives
the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

Hudson Holdings LLC (principals Avi Greenbaum and Steve Michael) are proposing an approximately $308 million
mixed-use project, HH Cleveland Huntington LP (“Project”). Hudson Holdings plans to revitalize the Huntington Building, with a mixed use redevelopment, encompassing retail, office, hotel and an apartment/condo product.
The project is located at the corner of East 9th Street and Euclid Avenue, one of the most prominent and central intersections in downtown Cleveland. Originally the Union Trust Building, and more recently the Huntington Building, the
Project has 1.3 million square feet and of that, 92% is currently vacant and in need of rehabilitation.

Developer
Hudson Holdings is deeply invested in commercial markets throughout the United States. Headquartered in Delray
Beach, FL, the company has a longstanding reputation as master planners, long-term investors, environmental stewards, and best-in-class managers of real estate. The principals of Hudson Holdings, Andrew Greenbaum and Steve
Michael, have bought and built over 4,000 residential units as well as over 3 million square feet of commercial space that
includes numerous dining and hospitality projects.
Proposed City Assistance:
The request to Cleveland City Council is to authorize the Director of Economic Development to enter into the chain of
title for certain properties associated with the project 925 Euclid redevelopment for the purpose of entering into a nonschool Tax Increment Finance (TIF) agreement with Hudson Holdings, LLC or its designee. These TIF funds will be
used to primarily finance construction for workforce housing and incubator space. This TIF agreement will be up to 30
years in length. The City will declare certain improvements with respect to the project to be a public purpose and exempt
100% of the improvements from real property taxes.
Under the agreement, parcels acquired and re-conveyed to the developer will be “TIFed” under section 5709.41 of the
Ohio Revised Code in consideration for the developer agreeing to make certain improvements to those parcels, and
agreeing to make payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT) equal to the taxes that would have been paid for those parcels but
for the TIF. A portion of the PILOT will be paid to the Cleveland Municipal School District in the amount the District
would have otherwise received but for the TIF.
This second piece of legislation is required by Cleveland City Council for approval of the TIF Agreement. The first
piece to allow the City to enter in to the chain of title was approved on June 6th, 2016.

Midwest Development Partners
The Midwest Development Partners LLC collaboration is a partnership of two Cleveland families, who invest, develop, own and manage real estate, both in Northeast Ohio and nationwide. The Goldberg/Ponsky and the Weiss families’
shared experiences have resulted in a professional and personal relationship spanning over three generations. Midwest
Development Partners LLC was formed to pursue these development opportunities and to function as the development
arm of the long standing relationships.
Project Description
Midwest Development Partners (principals Steve Rubin, Zac Ponsky and Elie Weiss) are proposing, Centric, an
approximately $78 million market rate mixed-use retail and residential apartment building with associated parking
garage. The project is located in University Circle at the intersection of Mayfield Road and a new extension of Circle
Drive. The site is located west of the Little Italy neighborhood, southeast of Uptown, and is immediately adjacent to
Abington Arms Apartments and the Cleveland Institute of Art. Centric is the latest version of the original Intesa project
started in 2012.
The existing site consists of a parking lot, known as Lot #45, and an existing street (E. 117th St.), which will be vacated. The proposed seven-story mixed-use building will have 28,000 SF of ground floor of retail space and residential lobbies. The upper six floors will contain 269 unique apartments and residential amenity spaces. The building will be designated to meet LEED silver certification. The six-story concrete garage will provide 360 parking spaces for residential
and public use. The total development cost for the project is approximately $78 million.
Proposed City Assistance:
The Developer has approached the City to help finance a portion of this project in the form of a TIF. Escalated construction costs including $10 million for the structured parking garage and $5.2 million in public infrastructure and roadway realignment are contributing to the project financing gap. Parking continues to be a challenge in the University
Circle neighborhood and the funding of this public portion of the project will assist with the neighborhood’s growing
need.

The costs associated with these public improvements exceed the value of the TIF proceeds. The TIF proceeds will be
used for repayment of eligible project debt related to these improvements. The Centric Team is working with other public funding sources to assist with the financing gap including a $360,000 grant from NEORSD, along with $900,000 in savings from the Port Authority’s Capital lease structure for tax exempt material. The TIF proceeds are the last public sector commitment needed to cover the gap and allow the project to go forward.
Construction is intended to begin in 2016 and to be completed by fall of 2017. The Developer has agreed to a Community Benefits Agreement which will include interns from Max Hayes High school. Substantial new taxes will also be
generated from operations of the property and its retail, management and residential occupants, including sales, sin,
commercial activities and income taxes from the projected 400 apartment residents and 75 permanent employees of the
project.
Economic Impact:
• Project anticipates 400 new residents
• Project estimates creation of at least 75 full-time permanent jobs
• Estimated $160,826 in anticipated Annual Income tax revenues to the City of Cleveland from residents and new jobs
• Redevelopment of currently vacant held, City owned property
• Project estimates $450,000 in property taxes for the School District annually
• Project estimates $184,413 in parking, income, and residence taxes annually
• Over the 30-year term of the TIF, the project estimates $13.5 Million in property taxes for the School District and $5.5
million in parking, income, and residence taxes for the City.
City Requirements:
• Loan is subject to the Fair Employment Law
• Loan is subject to the Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland Resident Employment Law
• Loan is subject to MBE/FBE/CSB
• Project will have a Workforce Development Agreement
Section 3. That, under Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code, Redeveloper (or the owners of the Improvements) shall
make service payments for a period of thirty years in lieu of the exempt taxes to the Cuyahoga County Treasurer; the
payments shall be charged and collected in the same manner, and shall be in an amount not less than the taxes that
would have been paid had the Improvements not been exempt from taxation.
Section 4. That a portion of the service payments collected under this ordinance shall be distributed by the Cuyahoga
County Treasurer to the Treasurer of the District in the amount of the taxes that would have been payable to the District had the Improvement not been exempt from taxation.

Increment Equivalent Fund into which shall be deposited service Payments in Lieu of Taxes (“PILOTS”) which shall be
used for the purposes described in this ordinance, or File, or for other economic development purposes as determined by
the Director of Economic Development.
Section 7. That it is found and determined that all formal actions of this Council concerning and relating to the passage of this ordinance were adopted in open meetings of this Council, and any of its committees that resulted in formal

Project Summary
The Dalad Group (“Dalad”) is proposing the Worthington Yards project, a renovation of five, 100-year old buildings at
725 Johnson Court in Downtown Cleveland. Dalad will convert the buildings into 98 market rate loft apartments with
heated indoor parking, a fitness center, and a restaurant space. Dalad also intends to develop two enclosed open areas
into courtyards, one private and one public. These spaces will distinguish Worthington Yards as the only downtown residential property with captive green space and 47 of the apartments will either have their own balcony or patio. The five
story project will occupy approximately 180,000 square feet when complete. There will be an estimated 63 one bedroom,
33 two bedroom, and 2 three bedroom apartments.
Dalad Group is a full service real estate company based in Independence, Ohio. Founded in 1947, Dalad has been an
innovative developer of office, industrial and retail space throughout the region. Dalad has completed numerous historic
renovation projects within the City of Cleveland, including the Hoyt Block featuring the Blue Point Restaurant, the Hat
Factory apartments on West 6th Street, 2320 Lofts located at 2320 Superior (serving CSU students) and the Creswell
Building at 1220 Huron Road. Dalad also has a local portfolio of nearly two and a half million square feet of commercial
real estate.
Proposed City Assistance:
The request to Cleveland City Council is to authorize the Director of Economic Development to enter into a non-school
Tax Increment Finance (TIF) agreement with Worthington Yards Ltd or its designee. These TIF funds will be used for
project debt associated with Worthington Yards. This TIF agreement will be up to 30 years in length. The City will
declare certain improvements with respect to the project to be a public purpose and exempt 100% of the improvements
from real property taxes.
Under the agreement, parcels acquired and re-conveyed to the developer will be “TIFed” under section 5709.41 of the
Ohio Revised Code in consideration for the developer agreeing to make certain improvements to those parcels, and
agreeing to make payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT) equal to the taxes that would have been paid for those parcels but

1765

for the TIF. A portion of the PILOT will be paid to the Cleveland Municipal School District by the Cuyahoga County Fiscal Officer in the amount the District would have otherwise received but for the TIF. The Borrower will be responsible
for any shortfall of PILOT payments for project costs.
This piece of legislation will complete the legislation required to enter into the TIF Agreement with the Developer.
