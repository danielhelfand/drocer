An emergency resolution urging
Giant Eagle not to close two local
stores and a Get-Go gas station in
Cleveland, and to work with the
City of Cleveland to retain these
stores in order to preserve access to
fresh foods and pharmacy services
for east and west side residents.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has been a partner with Giant Eagle
over the years, working towards the
development of new grocery stores
and Get-Go gas stations within the
City limits; and
Whereas, the recently announced
closing in February of two stores
located at East 116th Street and
Buckeye Road and 140th Street and
Lorain Avenue, and a Get-Go gas
station leaves only two Giant Eagle
stores left in a community of nearly 400,000 people, and marks the end
of Giant Eagle on the east side of
Cleveland; and
Whereas,
these
stores
provide
access to fresh foods and pharmacy
service
for
Cleveland
residents,
many of who are elderly and rely
on public transportation; and
Whereas, the impending closing of
three locations, puts 120 workers at
risk of losing their jobs; and
Whereas, the closing of pharmacies in mid-January leaves little
time for customers to transfer prescriptions, placing a hardship especially on our seniors and those with
disabilities; and
Whereas, if these Giant Eagle
stores close, the remaining lease
terms may prevent other grocery
stores from leasing at these locations, leaving vacant stores that
negatively influence our community
and affect other leases for nearby
retail; and
Whereas, this Council urges Giant
Eagle not to close these local stores,
and to discuss ways the City of
Cleveland may help retain them; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Giant Eagle not to close two local
stores and a Get-Go gas station in
Cleveland, and to work with the
City of Cleveland to retain these

14
stores in order to preserve access to
fresh foods and pharmacy services
for east and west side residents.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to Laura Karet, Chief
Executive Officer, Giant Eagle and

Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
