Whereas, Perry Payne, Ltd. now
desires to apply for HUD Mortgage
Insurance for Supplemental Loans
and in order to make the application, the City would have to consent
to subordinate its loans to new debt
and to restructure current debt and
agree to an extended repayment
term until 2056; and
Whereas, however, Perry Payne,
Ltd. has requested the opportunity
to prepay both loans at one/third of
their outstanding balances; and
Whereas, by accepting the prepayments, the Department of Community Development and the City
would realize an immediate influx
of funds rather than wait until 2056

Project Summary and Discussion
Health Tech Hospitality, LLC, or
designee, (“Developer”) is proposing
to develop a Hilton Tru, located at
6975 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH
44115 (“Project Site”). In order to
assist with the project financing,
the Developer has requested the
City impose a 5709.41, 30-Year, NonSchool TIF. The TIF will support
debt service related to the project
and assist with the development of
the hotel. The project will create
and/or cause to create 20 new W-2
jobs at the Project Site with an
approximate
payroll
of
$750,000.
TIF proceeds are estimated to generate approximately $1,448,771.
In 2015, the City sold parcels in
the block located at E. 69th-70th
Street between Euclid Avenue and
Chester Avenue out of the Industrial Commercial Land Bank.
Economic Development targeted this
property and worked with Midtown
Cleveland, who owned the remaining developable property to position
the site for redevelopment.
As development has continued,
HTH has acquired a license to the
development of a Hilton Tru, an
“upscale economy” hotel flag. Costs
for the FFE and construction and
design for “upscale” flag elevated
the original cost projections.
The
total
development
costs
have
increased from $12M to approximately $14M.
This has forced the
developer to raise more equity, but
not being able to provide the returns
required, thus making the project
infeasible.
Proposed City Assistance
• This ordinance will authorize the
Director of Economic Development to enter into a 30-year nonschool Tax Increment Finance
(TIF) agreement with Health
Tech Hospitality, LLC, and/or its
designee.
The City will have
declared
certain
improvements
with respect to the project to be
a public purpose and exempt
100% of the improvements from
real property taxes.
• The Developer agrees to make
certain improvements to the parcel and make payments in lieu of
taxes (PILOTs) equal to the

2212

December 13, 2017
taxes that would have been paid
for the parcel but for the TIF. A
portion of the PILOTs will be
paid to the Cleveland Metropolitan School District in the amount
the District would have otherwise
received but for the TIF by the
County
(“District
Payments”).
The balance of the PILOTS will
be utilized to fund eligible project
costs and project debt. The developer will be responsible for any
shortfall of PILOT payments for
project costs.

Cleveland
