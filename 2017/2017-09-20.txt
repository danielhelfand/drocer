RESOLUTIONS REFERRED
Res. No. 1049-17.
By Council Member McCormack.
An emergency resolution declaring the intent to vacate a portion of
West 6th Street.
Whereas, this Council is satisfied
that there is good cause to vacate a
portion of West 6th Street, as
described; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
declares its intent to vacate a portion of the following described real
property:
West 6th Street
Situated in the City of Cleveland,
County of Cuyahoga and State of
Ohio and known as being part of

shall take effect and be in force

from and after the earliest period

Projects, City Planning Commission,

Res. No. 1058-17.
By Council Members Cummins,
Brady, McCormack, Zone, J. Johnson, and Griffin.
An emergency resolution supporting
immigrant
youth,
including
those protected by DACA and supporting a federal law that would
continue the DACA program and
allow a path to citizenship for
Dreamers; opposing the withholding
of federal funding as a way to pressure local municipalities to enforce
federal
immigration
policies;
denouncing
anti-immigrant
bills
that promote racial profiling, discrimination
and
harassment
of
immigrant communities; and committing to working with the Jackson
administration
to
establish
strong policies to protect vulnerable
communities, especially immigrant
communities.
Whereas, nearly 800,000 young
people who came to the United
States as children have come forward, passed background checks,
and received permission to live and
work
in
America
through
the
Deferred
Action
for
Childhood
Arrivals
(DACA)
program;
with
DACA, they have advanced their
education, started small businesses,
and more fully established themselves as integral members of our
society; and
Whereas, despite his statements
that he will protect Dreamers, the
President has rescinded DACA effective about March 2018, calling upon
Congress to provide legislation to
manage Dreamers; as such, the fate
of
nearly
800,000
Dreamers
is
unknown; and
Whereas, the President has recently threatened to shut down the federal government in order to coerce
Congress to provide funds to build
a border wall; moreover, the Trump
administration continues to threaten
to withhold federal funding from
municipalities to pressure municipalities to enforce federal immigration law; and
Whereas, Immigration and Customs
Enforcement
(ICE)
has
renewed its effort to contract with
local sheriffs in an attempt to circumvent case law and facilitate
deportations; and
Whereas, the expansion of deportation and of local enforcement of
federal
immigration
laws
could
make everyone less safe because
when local law enforcement voluntarily cooperates with or works on
behalf of ICE, significant gaps in
trust and cooperation grow between
immigrant communities and local
police; some of these practices could
expose the city to liability for violations of individuals’ constitutional
rights; and
Whereas,
undue
collaboration
between local law enforcement and

The City Record
ICE will cause fear and insecurity
among immigrants and make immigrants less likely to report crimes,
act as witnesses in criminal investigations and prosecutions, and provide intelligence to law enforcement; and
Whereas, the cooperation of the
City’s immigrant communities is
essential
to
prevent
and
solve
crimes and maintain public order,
safety and security; further, community policing depends on trust
between all communities and facilitating deportations will harm the
City’s efforts at community policing;
and
Whereas, in May, 2017, the state
of Texas passed SB 4, an anti-immigrant bill that promotes racial profiling, discrimination and harassment of immigrant communities;
and
Whereas, elected officials across
Texas have stood up against SB 4
because it harms their ability to
keep their communities safe and
because it stands in direct conflict
to American values of respecting
and keeping safe all residents; and
Whereas, this Council understands
that government has a responsibility to ensure that every individual
and every family living in this country has the chance to succeed and
therefore denounces any anti-immigrant bill, like Texas’ SB 4; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that countries whose Temporary
Protected Status (TPS) designation
is set to expire be granted TPS
extensions so that eligible nationals
from these countries may continue
to receive work and travel authorization; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
values its ethnic, racial, linguistic,
and socio-economic diversity as a
source of strength and this Council
is committed to ensuring that all
our city’s residents live and pursue
their livelihoods in peace and prosperity; and
Whereas, this Council is committed to working with the mayor to
establish strong policies to protect
vulnerable communities, especially
immigrant communities, including
and to the extent legally possible:
limiting the co-optation of local
police by ICE; strong privacy protections limiting the sharing of confidential personal information with
federal agencies; adoption of clear
and transparent protocols for the
certification of U-Visas; vigorous
opposition to any government registry based on religion or national
origin; further this Council is committed to maintaining community
stakeholder
engagement
around
implementation of policies that preserve and protect our diverse and
inclusive city; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports immigrant youth, including
those protected by DACA and supports a federal law that would continue the DACA program and allow
a path to citizenship for Dreamers;
opposes the withholding of federal
funding as a way to pressure local
municipalities to enforce federal
immigration
policies;
denounces

anti-immigrant bills that promote
racial profiling, discrimination and
harassment of immigrant communities; and commits to working with
the Jackson administration to establish strong policies to protect vulnerable
communities,
especially
immigrant communities.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to the President of the United States, all members of Congress and all members of
the Ohio House and Senate.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

an

equalization
board to hear objections to estimated assessments with respect to the

Whereas, notice of the adoption of
the resolution and of the filing of
the estimated assessments will be

An emergency resolution supporting the City of Cleveland’s bid to
host the 2020 National Organization
of Black Law Enforcement Executives Conference; and supporting the
civic collaboration and efforts of
Cleveland with Destination Cleveland on behalf of hosting the conference in Cleveland in 2020.
Whereas, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement
Executives (“NOBLE”) serves as the
conscience of law enforcement by
being
committed
to
justice
by
action; and
Whereas, NOBLE has nearly 60
chapters and represents over 3,000
members worldwide that represent
chief executive officers and command-level law enforcement officials from federal, state, county,
municipal law enforcement agencies, and criminal justice practitioners; and
Whereas, efforts are now underway to submit competitive bids to
host the 2020 NOBLE Conference;
and
Whereas, Cleveland is the optimal
location to host the 2020 NOBLE
Conference, as it has the resources
necessary to host a successful conference; has the right location and
venue that will accommodate all
aspects of a National conference in
a manner that is logistically, comfortably and seamlessly easy to
access; and has more than enough
hotels located in close proximity to
the conference for the convenience
of attendees; and
Whereas, Cleveland is ranked as
the 4th Most Walkable City by
PCMA Convene; and
Whereas, Cleveland has trendy
restaurants, lounges and nighttime
hot spots complete with live music
all within walking distance from
the conference location and hotels;
and
Whereas,
Cleveland
has
top
attractions that are found nowhere
else in the world including but not
limited to, Playhouse Square Theatre District, Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame and Museum, the Cleveland
Museum of Art, Severance Hall, and
the Great Lakes Science Center; and
Whereas, easy and convenient
access through public transportation
is available to many of the attractions and restaurants in the downtown area with complimentary trolleys available from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00
p.m. with expanded service to the
Flats East Bank entertainment area;
and
Whereas, the City has partnered
with
Destination
Cleveland
to
achieve a successful bid for the 2020
NOBLE Conference; and
Whereas, Destination Cleveland
will provide up to 25 VIP welcome
baskets; will sponsor a luncheon for
the Teen Leadership Program for up
to 300 youth; will provide special

1610

September 20, 2017
VIP transportation for the Executive Board; will provide volunteers
to assist in the registration area, in
workshops, and for general conference requirements; and
Whereas, Destination Cleveland
has arranged with several downtown
hotels
for
discounts
and
rebates and will offset the meeting
space cost at the Huntington Convention Center with an additional
cost savings to take off of the rental
of the Convention Center; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that submitting a successful bid to host the 2020 NOBLE
Conference would have a positive
impact in the City and would be significant for our entire community;
now, therefore
