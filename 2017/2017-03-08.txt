ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 173-17.
By Council Member J. Johnson,
Brady,
Brancatelli,
Cleveland,
Conwell, Cummins, Dow, K. Johnson,
Kazy, Keane, Kelley, McCormack,
Mitchell, Polensek, Pruitt, Reed, and
Zone.
An emergency resolution opposing
the proposed repeal of the Affordable Care Act because of the catastrophic impact such repeal would
have on millions of Americans who
currently rely on it for health insurance coverage.
Whereas, members of the United
States Congress have resolved to
repeal the Affordable Care Act
(ACA) in 2017; and
Whereas, repeal of the ACA would
be catastrophic for millions of Americans who currently rely on the ACA
for health insurance coverage for
themselves and their families; and
Whereas, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), if
the ACA were repealed, the number
of people in the United States who
are uninsured would increase by 18
million in the first new plan year
after the ACA is repealed; and
Whereas, also according to the
CBO, after elimination of the ACA’s
expansion of Medicaid eligibility
and of subsidies for insurance purchased through the ACA marketplaces, the number of uninsured
would increase to 27 million, and
then to 32 million uninsured by 2026;
and
Whereas, the CBO states that premiums for individual policies purchased through the marketplaces or
directly
from
insurers
would
increase by 20-25% in the first new
plan year after the ACA is repealed;
and
Whereas, in Ohio, by December,
2016, an estimated 212,000 people
enrolled in marketplace coverage
and nearly 690,000 Ohioans enrolled
in coverage as a result of the Medicaid expansion; and
Whereas, according to the U.S.
Census Bureau, under the ACA and
with the expansion of Medicaid,
between 2013 and 2015, the number
of uninsured Ohio adults fell from
11% to 6.5%; and
Whereas, repeal of the ACA would
mean the slashing of federal funds
flowing to Ohio’s state budget, to its
health care providers and to Ohio
families who benefit from expanded
coverage;
further,
repeal
would
adversely impact the job security of
thousands of health care workers in
Cleveland and northeast Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the proposed repeal of the Affordable Care Act because of the catastrophic impact such repeal would
have on millions of Americans who
currently rely on it for health insurance coverage.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to the President of the
United States, all members of the U.S.
Congress and all members of the Ohio
legislature.

30
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted February 27, 2017.
Effective February 28, 2017.
