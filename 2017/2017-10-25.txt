FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 1293-17.
By Council Members Brancatelli
and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
Congress to preserve the federal
Historic Tax Credit in its efforts at
tax reform and its proposed budget
plan and encouraging Ohio members
of Congress to cosponsor the Historic Tax Credit Improvement Act.
Whereas, the federal Historic Tax
Credit (HTC) was created in 1981 as
a tool to drive economic development through the restoration and
reuse of America’s historic buildings; and
Whereas, the HTC is a widely
used redevelopment tool, helping to
revitalize cities, towns and rural
communities across the country; the
HTS stimulates economic growth
through private investment that creates jobs; and
Whereas, the HTC program establishes a 20% income tax credit for
the
rehabilitation
of
historic,
income-producing buildings that are
determined by the U.S. Secretary of
the Interior, through the National
Park Service, to be certified historic
structures; and
Whereas, the tax incentives for
preservation
attract
private
investment to the historic cores of

October 25, 2017
cities and towns; generate jobs,
enhance
property
values,
and
augment revenues for state and local
governments
through
increased
property, business and income taxes;
and
Whereas, cities like Cleveland
lack authority to raise local revenues to offset deep and unending
cuts to federal grants and tax incentives; this means that tax incentives
like
HTC
are
irreplaceable
as
sources of financing for local community and economic development;
and
Whereas, recently, federal Republican leadership released a tax
reform framework that does not
specifically preserve the HTC and
“envisions” that most business tax
credits will be repealed; and
Whereas, while the need for tax
reform is clear, it must not come at
the expense of the HTC: an important economic redevelopment incentive that more than pays for itself,
and has a proven track record of
creating jobs, saving historic buildings and revitalizing neighborhoods;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Congress to preserve the federal
Historic Tax Credit in its efforts at
tax reform and its proposed budget
plan.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
encourages all Ohio members of congress to cosponsor the Historic Tax
Credit Improvement Act.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to the members of
the U.S. House Ways and Means
Committee, the Senate Finance Committee, and Downtown Cleveland
Alliance.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

yield the right-of-way to vehicles
lawfully within the intersection at
the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.

indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the

officer to submit to a chemical test
or tests under RC 4511.191 or any
substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, and being advised by the
officer
in
accordance
with
RC
4511.192 or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance of the
consequences of the person’s refusal
or submission to the test or tests,
refuse to submit to the test or tests.
(b) Underage alcohol consumption. No person under twenty-one
(21) years of age shall operate any
vehicle, streetcar, or trackless trolley within this City if, at the time
of the operation, any of the following apply:
(1) The person has a concentration of at least 0.02% but less than
0.08% by weight per unit volume of
alcohol in the person’s whole blood;
(2) The person has a concentration of at least 0.03% but less than
0.096% by weight per unit volume of
alcohol in the person’s blood serum
or plasma;
(3) The person has a concentration of at least 0.02 grams but less
than 0.08 grams by weight of alcohol per two hundred and ten (210)
liters of the person’s breath;
(4) The person has a concentration of at least 0.028 grams but less
than 0.11 grams by weight of alcohol per one hundred (100) milliliters
of the person’s urine.
(c) Prosecution; limitation on convictions. In any proceeding arising
out of one (1) incident, a person
may be charged with a violation of
division (a)(1)A. or (a)(2) and a
violation of division (b)(1), (b)(2)
or (b)(3) of this section, but the person may not be convicted of more
than one (1) violation of these divisions.
(d) Evidence; tests.
(1) A. In any criminal prosecution
for a violation of division (a)(1)A.
of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is vehicle-related, the
result of any test of any blood or

in RC 2317.02, may be admitted with
expert testimony to be considered
with any other relevant and competent evidence in determining the
guilt or innocence of the defendant.

1851

31
B. In any criminal prosecution for
a violation of division (a) or (b) of
this section or for an equivalent
offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the
concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse,
controlled
substances,
metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination of them in
the defendant’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, urine or
other bodily substance at the time
of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance
withdrawn within three (3) hours of
the time of the alleged violation.
The three (3) hour time limit specified in this division regarding the
admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two (2) hour
time
limit
specified
in
RC
4511.192(A) as the maximum period
of time during which a person may
consent to a chemical test or tests
as described in that section. The
court may admit evidence on the
concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as
described in this division when a
person submits to a blood, breath,
urine, or other bodily substance test
at the request of a law enforcement
officer under RC 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or urine sample is
obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a
qualified
technician,
chemist
or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood
sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of
the whole blood, blood serum or
blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or
urine specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this
division may refuse to withdraw
blood under this division, if in that
person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn
under this division (d)(1)B. shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Ohio Director
of Health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the
Director pursuant to RC 3701.143.
C. As used in division (d)(1)B. of
this section, “emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “emergency
medical
technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as
in RC 4765.01.
(2) In a criminal prosecution for
a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, if there was
at the time the bodily substance was
withdrawn a concentration of less
than the applicable concentration of
alcohol
specified
in
divisions
(a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D.
and
(a)(1)E. of this section or less than
the applicable concentration of a
listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of
division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other
competent evidence in determining
the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or
affect a criminal prosecution for a
violation of division (b) of this section.

32
(3) Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of
the chemical test shall be made
available to the person or the person’s attorney, immediately upon the
completion of the chemical test
analysis. If the chemical test was
obtained
pursuant
to
division
(d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the
person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law
enforcement officer. If the person
was under arrest as described in
division (g)(5) of this section or RC
4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer
shall advise the person at the time
of the arrest that the person may
have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other
than described in RC 4511.191(A)(5),
the form to be read to the person to
be tested, as required under division
(g) of this section, shall state that
the person may have an independent
test
performed
at
the
person’s
expense. The failure or inability to
obtain an additional chemical test
by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to
the chemical test or tests taken at
the request of a law enforcement
officer.
(4) A. As used in division (d)(4)B.
and (d)(4)C. of this section, “National Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
established as an administration of
the United States Department of
Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415
(1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
B. In any criminal prosecution for
a violation of division (a) or (b) of
this section, of a municipal ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol
and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to operating
a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or
urine, if a law enforcement officer
has administered a field sobriety
test to the operator of the vehicle
involved in the violation and if it is
shown by clear and convincing evidence that the officer administered
the test in substantial compliance
with the testing standards for any
reliable,
credible
and
generally
accepted field sobriety tests that
were in effect at the time the tests
were administered, including but
not limited to any testing standards
then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, all of the following
apply:
1. The officer may testify concerning the results of the field sobriety test so administered.
2. The prosecution may introduce
the results of the field sobriety test
so administered as evidence in any
proceedings in the criminal prosecution.
3. If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under division
(d)(4)B.1. or (d)(4)B.2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is admissible under the Rules
of Evidence, the court shall admit

The City Record
the testimony or evidence and the
trier of fact shall give it whatever
weight the trier of fact considers to
be appropriate.
C. Division (d)(4)B. of this section
does not limit or preclude a court,
in its determination of whether the
arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination
of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
division, from considering evidence
or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by division (d)(4)B. of
this section.
(e) Laboratory report.
(1) Subject to division (e)(3) of
this section, in any criminal prosecution for a violation of division
(a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D.,
(a)(1)E.,
(a)(1)F.,
(a)(1)G.,
(a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)(1)J. or
(b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) of
this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a laboratory report from any laboratory
personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing
an analysis as described in this division that contains an analysis of the
whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine or other bodily substance tested and that contains all
of the information specified in this
division shall be admitted as prima
facie evidence of the information
and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report shall
contain all of the following:
A. The signature, under oath, of
any
person
who
performed
the
analysis;
B. Any findings as to the identity
and quantity of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, a controlled substance, a
metabolite of a controlled substance,
or a combination of them that was
found;
C. A copy of a notarized statement
by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or test performer involved with
the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment
relationship
with the laboratory that issued the
report, and a notation that performing an analysis of the type involved
is part of the analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
D. An outline of the analyst’s or
test performer’s education, training
and experience in performing the
type of analysis involved and a certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Ohio Department of Health.
(2) Notwithstanding any other
provision of law regarding the
admission of evidence, a report of
the type described in division (e)(1)
of this section is not admissible
against the defendant to whom it
pertains in any proceeding, other
than a preliminary hearing or a
grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the
report on the defendant’s attorney
or, if the defendant has no attorney,
on the defendant.
(3) A report of the type described
in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of
the contents, identity or amount of
any substance if, within seven (7)
days after the defendant to whom
the report pertains or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of

1852

October 25, 2017
the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the
testimony of the person who signed
the report. The judge in the case
may extend the seven (7) day time
limit in the interest of justice.
(f) Limitation of liability.
(1) Except as otherwise provided
in this division, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency
technician-paramedic,
or
medical
technician,
chemist
or
qualified
phlebotomist who withdraws blood
from a person pursuant to this section or RC 4511.19, 4511.191 or
4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station or clinic at which blood is
withdrawn from a person pursuant
to this section or RC 4511.19, 4511.191
or 4511.192, is immune from criminal
liability and civil liability based
upon a claim of assault and battery
or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act
performed in withdrawing blood
from the person. The immunity provided in this division also extends
to an emergency medical service
organization that employs an emergency medical technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic
who
withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engages
in willful or wanton misconduct.
(2) As used in division (f)(1),
“emergency medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical
technician-paramedic”
have
the
same meanings as in RC 4765.01.
(RC 4511.19(A) - (F))
(g) Implied consent.
(1) Definitions. For the purpose of
this division (g), the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
A. “Alcohol monitoring device”
means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any
ignition interlock device, any immobilizing or disabling device other
than an ignition interlock device
that is constantly available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in
a person’s system, or any other
device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting
of alcohol consumption by a person
and that a court orders a person to
use as a sanction imposed as a
result of the person’s conviction of
or plea of guilty to an offense.
B. “Physical control” has the same
meaning as in RC 4511.194.
C. “Community Addiction Services
Provider” has the same meaning as
in RC 5119.01.
(2) Implied consent to chemical
tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle, streetcar, or trackless trolley upon a highway or any public
or private property used by the public for vehicular travel or parking
within this municipality or who is
in physical control of a vehicle,
streetcar, or trackless trolley shall
be deemed to have given consent to
a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination
content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or
urine if arrested for a violation of
division (a), (b) or (o) of this section, RC 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194

October 25, 2017
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance.
(3) Tests at request of law
enforcement agent. The chemical
test or tests under division (g)(2) of
this section shall be administered at
the request of a law enforcement
officer having reasonable grounds
to believe the person was operating
or in physical control of a vehicle,
streetcar, or trackless trolley in violation of a division, section or ordinance identified in division (g)(2)
of this section. The law enforcement
agency by which the officer is
employed shall designate which of
the tests shall be administered.
(4) Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead
or unconscious, or who otherwise is
in a condition rendering the person
of
refusal,
shall
be
incapable
deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of this section and the test or tests may be
administered, subject to RC 313.12 to
313.16.
(5) Chemical tests.
A. If a law enforcement officer
arrests a person for a violation of
division (a) or (b) of this section,
RC 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if convicted would be required to be sentenced under division (h)(1)(C),
(h)(1)(D), or (h)(1)(E), or under
RC 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (G)(1)(d) or
(G)(1)(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the person shall submit, to
a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol,
drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance,
or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law
enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division
that a person submit to a chemical
test or tests is not required to advise
the person of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to submit
to, the test or tests and is not
required to give the person the form
described in division (g)(7) of this
section, but the officer shall advise
the person at the time of the arrest
that if the person refuses to take a
chemical
test
the
officer
may
employ whatever reasonable means
are necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum
or plasma. The officer shall also
advise the person at the time of the
arrest that the person may have an
independent chemical test taken at
the person’s own expense. Divisions
(g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a
chemical test or tests pursuant to
this division.
B. If a person refuses to submit to
a chemical test upon a request made
pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this
section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ
whatever reasonable means are necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood or blood serum or
plasma. A law enforcement officer
who acts pursuant to this division
to ensure that a person submits to
a chemical test of the person’s

The City Record
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and
civil liability based upon a claim for
assault and battery or any other
claim for the acts, unless the officer
so acted with malicious purpose, in
bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.
(RC 4511.191(A))
(6) Advice required. Except as
provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in
accordance with this division to any
person under arrest for a violation
of division (a), (b) or (o) of this
RC
4511.19(A)
or
(B),
section,
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any
other municipal O.V.I. ordinance.
The officer shall give that advice in
a written form that contains the
information described in division
(g)(7) of this section and shall read
the advice to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the
form was shown to the person under
arrest and read to the person by the
arresting officer. One (1) or more
persons shall witness the arresting
officer’s reading of the form, and
the witnesses shall certify to this
fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the chemical test
or tests, subsequent to the request
of the arresting officer, within two
(2) hours of the time of the alleged
violation and, if the person does not
submit to the test or tests within
that two (2) hour time limit, the
failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the
test or tests.
(7) Certification of arrest. Except
as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under
arrest
as
described
in
division
(g)(6) of this section, before the
person may be requested to submit
to a chemical test or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance or combination
content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath or
urine, the arresting officer shall
read the following form to the person:
“You now are under arrest for
(specifically state the offense under
state law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which
the person was arrested – operating
a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug, or a combination of
them; operating a vehicle while
under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the
influence).
“If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended
immediately, and you will have to
pay a fee to have the privileges
reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I., O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding
20 years, you are now under arrest
for state O.V.I., and, if you refuse to
take a chemical test, you will face
increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state
O.V.I.

1853

33
(Read this part unless the person
is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while
under the influence.) “If you take
any chemical test required by law
and are found to be at or over the
prohibited amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of
a controlled substance in your whole
blood
serum
or
plasma,
blood,
breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will
have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
“If you take a chemical test, you
may have an independent chemical
test taken at your own expense.”
(8) Actions required by arresting
officer. If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person
under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) of this section or division
(g)(6) of this section to submit to a
chemical test or tests under RC
4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or
out-of-state driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to
the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If
the arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or
permit or it is not in the person’s
vehicle, the officer shall order the
person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs
the officer within twenty-four (24)
hours after the arrest, and, upon the
surrender, the agency immediately
shall forward the license or permit
to the court in which the person is
to appear on the charge. Upon
receipt of the license or permit, the
court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance
and any action taken under RC
4511.196.
(9) Duties of officer.
A. If a law enforcement officer
asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test
or tests under that division and the
test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of
a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense, or if a law
enforcement officer asks a person
under arrest as described in division
(g)(6) of this section to submit to a
chemical test or tests under RC
4511.191 or this section, the officer
advises the person in accordance
with this section of the consequences of the person’s refusal or
submission, and either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests
or, unless the arrest was for a violation of division (o) of this section,
RC 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and
the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance or a metabolite of
a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath or urine at the time
of the alleged offense, the arresting
officer shall do all of the following:
1. On behalf of the Registrar of
Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties
or sanctions imposed upon the person, the person’s Ohio driver’s or

34
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that
the suspension will last at least
until the person’s initial appearance
on the charge, which will be held
within five (5) days after the date
of
the
person’s
arrest
or
the
issuance of a citation to the person,
and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance
or during the period of time ending
thirty (30) days after that initial
appearance;
2. Seize the driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to
the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s
license or permit or it is not in the

order the person to surrender it to
the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within twentyfour (24) hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and,
upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall
forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
3. Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from that on
the person’s driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit, notify the
Registrar of the change;
4. Send to the Registrar, within
forty-eight (48) hours after the
arrest of the person, a sworn report
that includes all of the following
statements:
a. That the officer had reasonable
grounds to believe that, at the time
of the arrest, the arrested person
was operating a vehicle, streetcar,
or trackless trolley in violation of
RC 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal
O.V.I. ordinance or for being in
physical control of a stationary
vehicle, streetcar, or trackless trolley in violation of RC 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance;
b. That the person was arrested
and charged with a violation of RC
4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
c. Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of
this section applies, that the officer
asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this
section of the consequences of submitting to, or refusing to take, the
test or tests, and gave the person
the
form
described
in
division
(g)(7) of this section;
d. Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of
this section applies, that either the
person refused to submit to the
chemical test or tests or, unless the
arrest was for a violation of RC
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person
submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a
prohibited concentration of alcohol,
a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath or urine at the time
of the alleged offense;
e. If the person was under arrest
as described in division (g)(5) of
this section and the chemical test or
tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person
was under arrest as described in
that division, that the chemical test

The City Record
or tests were performed in accordance with that division, and that
test results indicated a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of
a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
B. Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, RC 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a
chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the test or
tests, regardless of the amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a
metabolite of a controlled substance
that the test results indicate is present in the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath or
urine.
(10) Sworn report of arresting
officer.
A. The arresting officer shall give
the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the
arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor
Vehicles shall send the report to the
person by regular first-class mail as
soon as possible after receipt of the
report, but not later than fourteen
(14) days after receipt of it. An
arresting
officer
may
give
an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest, provided the report is complete when
given to the arrested person and
subsequently is sworn to by the
arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than forty-eight
(48) hours after the arrest of the
person, the arresting officer shall
send a copy of the sworn report to
the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge for
which the person was arrested.
B. The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section is prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and
considered as prima facie proof of
the information and statements that
it contains in any appeal under RC
4511.197 relative to any suspension
of a person’s driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating
privilege
that
results from the arrest covered by
the report.
(RC 4511.192)
(11) Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license
or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the
time described in RC 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from
the time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension
upon the arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is
not guilty of the charge that resulted in the person’s being requested
to take the chemical test or tests
under
division
(g)(1)
through
(g)(5) of this section does not affect
the suspension.

construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age

based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to
the harm alleged in the tort action

could have been recovered but for
the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of

not wearing an available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing

a device, or was not wearing such
a device as properly adjusted, then,
consistent with the Rules of Evidence, the fact that the occupant
was not wearing the available occupant restraining device, was not
wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was not
wearing such a device as properly
adjusted is admissible in evidence
in relation to any claim for relief in
a tort action to the extent that the
claim for relief satisfies all of the

(a) (1) For purposes of this section, “junk motor vehicle” means
any
motor
vehicle
meeting
the
requirements of RC 4513.63 (B), (C),
(D), and (E) that is left uncovered
in the open on private property for
more than seventy-two (72) hours
with the permission of the person
having the right to possession of the
property, except if the person is
operating a junk yard or scrap
metal processing facility licensed
under the authority of RC 4737.05
through 4737.12, or regulated under
authority of the city; or if the property on which the motor vehicle is
left is not subject to licensure or
regulation by any governmental
authority, unless the person having
the right to the possession of the
property can establish that the
motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation; or if the
motor vehicle is a collector’s vehicle.
(2) This section shall not prevent
a person from storing or keeping, or
restrict a person in the method of
storing or keeping, any collector’s
vehicle on private property with the
permission of the person having the
right to the possession of the property; except that a person having
such permission may be required to
conceal, by means of buildings,
fences, vegetation, terrain or other
suitable obstruction, any unlicensed
collector’s vehicle stored in the
open.
(3) The Police Chief or his
designee may send notice, by certified
mail
with
return
receipt
requested, to the person having the

receipt of the notice, the junk motor
vehicle either shall be covered by
being housed in a garage or other
suitable
structure,
or
shall
be
removed from the property.
(4) No person shall willfully leave
a junk motor vehicle uncovered in
the open for more than ten (10)
days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. The fact that
a junk motor vehicle is so left is
prima facie evidence of willful failure to comply with the notice, and
each subsequent period of thirty
(30) days that a junk motor vehicle
continues to be so left constitutes a
separate offense.
(RC 4513.65)
(d) Whoever violates this section
is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on
a first offense; on a second offense,
such person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on
each subsequent offense, such person is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the third degree.

shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

physical welfare of the defendant or
child would be endangered by withdrawing blood.
The whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, urine, or breath withdrawn
under division (d)(1)B. of this section shall be analyzed in accordance
with methods approved by the director of health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the
director pursuant to RC  3701.143.
(2)  In a criminal prosecution or
juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a) of this section

1869

49
or for an equivalent offense that is
watercraft-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was
taken a concentration of less than
the applicable concentration of alcohol specified for a violation of division (a)(2), (3), (4), or (5) of this
section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of
a controlled substance specified for
a violation of division (a)(6) of this
section, that fact may be considered
with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence
of the defendant or in making an
adjudication for the child. This division does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of division (b) of this section or for a violation of a prohibition that is substantially equivalent to that division.

may have a physician, a registered
nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests in addition to
any administered at the direction of
a law enforcement officer, and shall
be so advised. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the test
or tests taken at the direction of a
law enforcement officer.
(e)(1)  In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
a violation of division (a) or (b) of
this section, or other chapter of
these Codified Ordinances relating
to operating or being in physical
control of any vessel underway or
to manipulating any water skis,
aquaplane, or similar device on the
waters of this state while under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or a combination of them, or
other chapter of these Codified Ordinances relating to operating or
being in physical control of any vessel underway or to manipulating
any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device on the waters of this
state with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or
urine, if a law enforcement officer
has administered a field sobriety
test to the operator or person found
to be in physical control of the vessel underway involved in the violation or the person manipulating the
water skis, aquaplane, or similar
device involved in the violation and
if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing standards
for reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests for
vehicles that were in effect at the
time the tests were administered,
including, but not limited to, any
testing standards then in effect that
have been set by the national highway traffic safety administration,
that by their nature are not clearly
inapplicable regarding the operation

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or evidence, and the trier of
fact shall give it whatever weight
the trier of fact considers to be

of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
division, from considering evidence
or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by division (e)(1) of this
section.
(f) (1)  Subject to division (f)(3)
of this section, in any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding
for a violation of division (a) or (b)
of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to either of those divisions, the
court shall admit as prima-facie evidence a laboratory report from any
laboratory personnel issued a permit
by the department of health authorizing an analysis as described in
this division that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine, or other
bodily substance tested and that

in division (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of
the contents, identity, or amount of
any substance if, within seven days
after the defendant or child to
whom the report pertains or the
defendant’s
or
child’s
attorney
receives a copy of the report, the
defendant or child or the defendant’s or child’s attorney demands
the testimony of the person who

The
court may require the offender, as a
condition of community control, to
attend and satisfactorily complete

attendance at a drivers’ intervention
program, that the operators of the
drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender should attend
and to report periodically to the
court on the offender’s progress in
the programs. The court also may
impose any other conditions of community control on the offender that
it considers necessary.
(2) If, within ten (10) years of the

violation of RC  1547.11  or one other

sentence the offender to a jail term
of ten (10) consecutive days and
may sentence the offender pursuant

(4)  Upon a showing that serving
a jail term would seriously affect
the ability of an offender sentenced
pursuant to division (j)(1), (2), or
(3) of this section to continue the
offender’s employment, the court
may authorize that the offender be
granted work release after the
offender has served the mandatory
jail term of three (3), ten (10), or
thirty (30) consecutive days that the
court is required by division (j)(1),
(2), or (3) of this section to impose.
No

being imprisoned or serving a jail
term until after the offender has
served the mandatory jail term of
ten (10) or thirty (30) consecutive
days required to be imposed pursuant to division (j)(2) or (3) of

of being imprisoned or serving a jail
term, no court, except as specifically authorized by division (j)(1) of

Project Summary and Discussion
Terminal Tower was built in the
1930’s, and KD Tower City LLC, an
affiliate of KD Management plans
substantial renovation and adaptive
reuse, while preserving the historic
interior of the building. The developer proposes to convert floors 4
through 14 from office space to
approximately 260,000 SF of residential space. When complete, the
floors will have 304 units: 156 of
which will be 1-bedroom, 88 will be
deluxe units, and 61 will be 2-bedroom units. The developer will also
renovate some existing office space
to attract more tenants to the building. Lastly, the developer will make
improvements to the adjacent North
Park Garage.
The
Department
of
Economic
Development is requesting approval
to enter into a non-school Tax Increment Financing agreement with KD
Tower City LLC, or its designee, to
help the financial feasibility of the
project. The developer will make
PILOT payments to use for debt service. The renovation is estimated to
cost $101.7 million.
The additional housing proposed
with this project will provide much
needed supply to an area that is in
high demand for people looking to
live downtown—where occupancy
has soared to nearly 98%. Further,
located
directly
above
housing
downtown’s primary transit hub for
RTA provides access anywhere in
the city without the need for a car.
As young professionals and empty
nesters flock to downtown they are
sure to be attracted to this project
for the possibility of living among
many
amenities
downtown
the
offers while maintaining the ease of
access beyond downtown. The redevelopment is expected to be completed in fourth quarter of 2019.
Developer
KD Tower City LLC is an entity
of K&D Management. As Chief
Executive Officer of K&D, Douglas
Price has been involved in all facets
of the real estate industry for over
32 years, and in conjunction with
his partner, Karen M. Paganini, has
built the largest privately owned
and managed portfolio of multi-family properties in Northeast Ohio. The
K&D portfolio includes a number of
mixed-use
properties,
with
over
2,000,000 SF of commercial and retail
space including the Halle Building,
Leader Building, and Keith Building. The newest addition to the portfolio is the historic landmark of Terminal Tower, which K&D purchased
in 2016.
Proposed City Assistance:
The request to Cleveland City
Council is to authorize the Director
of Economic Development to enter
into a non-school Tax Increment
Finance (TIF) agreement with KD
Tower City LLC or its designee. The
TIF proceeds will be used for debt
payments associated with the project. This TIF agreement will be up
to 30 years in length.
Under
the
agreement,
parcels
acquired and re-conveyed to the
developer will be “TIFed” under section 5709.41 of the Ohio Revised
Code in consideration for the developer
agreeing
to
make
certain
improvements to those parcels, and
agreeing to make payments in lieu
of taxes (PILOT) equal to the taxes
that would have been paid for those

parcels but for the TIF. A portion
of the PILOT will be paid to the
Cleveland Municipal School District
in the amount the District would
have otherwise received but for the
TIF.
Economic Impact
