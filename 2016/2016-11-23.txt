An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Community

consent
to
the
assignment of HOME Loan Contract

enter into an amendment to the
assigned contract regarding certain
terms.
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 7512000, passed June 19, 2000, this Council authorized the Director of Community Development to enter into
agreements with various housing
development
entities,
or
their
designees, to implement the Housing Trust Fund Program; and
Whereas, one of the contracts
entered into under that ordinance
was HOME Loan Contract No. 57501
with Glenville Development Corporation (“Glenville”) to implement its
Glenville Elderly Project located at

November 23, 2016

9380 St. Clair Avenue, which is a
low-income housing tax credit project; and
Whereas, Glenville has ceased
operations and is now defunct; and
Whereas, in 2013 the Famicos
Foundation
(“Famicos”)
actively

Whereas, Famicos is seeking to
acquire the property and to refinance the existing first mortgage in
order to sustain the operation of the
building and the Glenville Elderly
Project; and
Whereas, Glenville has consented
to the assignment of the HOME
Loan Contract to Famicos; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Community Development is authorized to consent to the request of
Glenville to assign the obligations

HOME Loan Contract No. 57501,
assigned by Section 1 of this ordinance (“Amendment”), with Famicos, containing the following new

b. At maturity the $200,000 loan is
forgiven assuming that the project
remains and continues to operate as
affordable housing for seniors at
60% of the Area Median Income
(“AMI”).

c. The City agrees to subordinate
the loan upon Famicos’ successful
attempt to recapitalize the property
with additional equity/loans if a
new first position loan is required
by a recapitalization.
d. Amend the interest rate to
0.00%.
e. Forgive the $22,217 of deferred
interest and any accrued interest as
of the amendment date.
f. Amend the agreement to forgive
any debt service payments out of
the net cash flow as long as the
property continues to operate as
affordable housing for seniors at
Famicos will need to
60% AMI.
fund an operating reserve with any
surplus cash flow due to the anticipated increase in taxes with the
expiration of the abatement and the
increase in water and sewer expenses.
Section 3. That the Director of
Community Development is authorized to execute all documents and
do all things necessary and appropriate to effect the consent to the
Assignment and amendments authorized by this legislation. A copy of
the Assignment shall be filed in the

of
the

shall be prepared by the Director of
