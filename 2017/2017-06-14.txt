44113, Permit Number 8980087; and

Res. No. 746-17.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Brancatelli, Zone, Brady,
Cleveland, Conwell, Cummins, Dow,
Griffin, J. Johnson, K. Johnson, Kazy,
Keane, Kelley, McCormack, Polensek,
Pruitt, and Reed.
An emergency resolution joining
Mayor Jackson in reaffirming the
City’s commitment to taking action
to reduce climate pollution and in
reaffirming the City’s continued support of the principles of the Paris
Climate Accord; and supporting the
Mayor in his decision to join Climate Mayors in defense of a worldwide climate action plan.
Whereas, this City desires to protect and enhance quality of life for
all those who live, work, learn and
play in our community, as well as
for our children and grandchildren;
and
Whereas, there is scientific consensus regarding the reality of climate change and the recognition
that human activity, especially the
combustion of fossil fuels that create greenhouse gases, is an important driver of climate change; and
Whereas, climate change has been
widely recognized by government,
business and academic leaders as a
worldwide threat with the potential
to harm our economy, safety, public
health, and quality of life; and
Whereas, members of our community and others are already feeling
the
effects
of
climate
change
through
increased
temperatures,
more extreme weather events, and
other disruptions that affect our residents, economy, and way of life;
and
Whereas, many local, regional,
and global economies are in the

The City Record
process of prioritizing efficiency
and
transitioning
to
low-carbon
energy sources; and
Whereas, actions that reduce climate pollution also have potential to
improve air quality, public health,
energy security, our local natural
environment, and quality of life for
our residents; and
Whereas, taking steps to increase
efficiency and resilience can attract
jobs
and
economic
development
opportunities to our community and
increase our long-term economic
competitiveness and wealth; and
Whereas, Cleveland has demonstrated
a
legacy
of
leadership
against
the
threat
of
climate
change, for example:
• in 2013, the City worked with 50
organizations
to
create
the
Cleveland Climate Action Plan
which includes a goal of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions 80% by
2050;
• the City signed onto the Global
Covenant of Mayors for Climate
and Energy, and has annually
reported our citywide emissions
to the Carbon Disclosure Project;
• the Funders' Network for Smart
Growth and Livable Communities
has recently awarded Cleveland a
grant to update its Climate
Action Plan;
• in
2015-2016
the
Cleveland
Climate Action Fund supported
25 resident-led, neighborhoodbased projects;
• the Cleveland Energy Saver
program which complements the
existing weatherization program
provided more than 150 home
energy retrofits;
• Cleveland received a $40 million
grant from the U.S. Department of
Energy to complete the first
freshwater offshore wind project
in North America;
• Cleveland Public Power is on
track to have 25% of its
electricity come from renewable
sources by 2025;
• between 2014-2016, 46 miles of
new bike infrastructure has been
installed throughout the City;
• the City launched the Cleveland
Tree Plan, which has a goal of
50,000 new trees by 2020 and an
increased canopy from 19% to
30% by 2040;
• the City distributed more than
4,000 rain barrels to Cleveland
residents through the Mayor’s
Summer
Youth
Employment
Program; and
Whereas, we are joined in taking
action on climate change by a global coalition of cities, state and
national governments and community and private sector leaders who
recognize the importance and potential of these actions to protect and
enhance the well-being of current
and future generations; and
Whereas, more than two hundred
(200)
mayors
representing
more
than 50 million Americans have
recently
re-affirmed
their
cities’
commitments to climate action; and
Whereas, Cleveland actively collaborates with other local governments throughout our region, state,
nation, and the world to learn from
each other and identify win-win
opportunities to take action on climate change while creating measurable benefits in our communities;
and
Whereas, 195 countries, including
the United States, vowed to address

1094

June 14, 2017
climate
change
in
agreements
reached in Paris in December 2015
(the “Paris Climate Accord”); and
Whereas, on June 1, 2017, the
President
withdrew
the
United
States from the Accord, saying it is
disadvantageous to the U.S.; and
Whereas, the reality of climate
change has not been affected by
recent political announcements; and
Whereas, although the federal
government refuses to commit to
working with the rest of the world
to combat global climate change,
the Mayor and this Council will continue to stand with cities and other
public and private sector partners
throughout the world to advance
action in accordance with the goals
outlined in the Paris Accord; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council joins
Mayor Jackson in reaffirming the
City’s commitment to taking action
to reduce climate pollution and in
reaffirming the City’s continued support of the principles of the Paris
Climate Accord; and supports the
Mayor in his decision to join Climate Mayors in defense of a worldwide climate action plan.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to the President of the
United States; the members of the U.S.
Congress representing Ohio; Governor
John Kasich; all members of the Ohio
legislature; the Climate Mayors; the
U.S. Conference of Mayors; and the
National League of Cities.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

An emergency ordinance repealing the moratorium on the issuance
of $100 tickets for infractions related to setting out excessively large
quantities of waste for collection in
the City of Cleveland, and authorizing the Director of Public Works to
resume issuing such tickets appropriately and accurately.
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 75316, passed June 6, 2016, this Council
declared
a
moratorium
on
the
issuance of $100 tickets for infractions related to setting out excessively large quantities of waste for
collection in the City of Cleveland
until authorization is reestablished
by Council; this moratorium does not
extend to the issuance of tickets in
the amount of $350 for setting out
super-excessive amounts of solid
waste; and
Whereas, section 551.991 authorizes the Director of Public Works
to issue a ticket for $100 to the
responsible party who commits a
violation
of,
inter
alia,
section
551.111 divisions (a) and (b), which
prohibit setting out a quantity of
waste exceeding five (5) approved
waste containers, twenty (20) bags
of yard waste, twenty (20) bundles
of brush or tree trunks, four (4)
tires, or three (3) special waste
items in either a manual collection
zone or an automated collection
zone; and
Whereas,
section
551.991
also
authorizes the Director of Public
Works to issue a ticket for $350 to
the responsible party if the quantity of solid waste exceeds ten (10)
approved waste containers, forty
(40) bags of yard waste, forty (40)
bundles of brush or tree trunks,
eight (8) tires, or six (6) special
waste items; and
Whereas,
this
Council
has
received countless complaints from
residents whose neighbors are violating section 551.111 by setting out
excessively
large
quantities
of
waste under that code section, but
are not being given $100 tickets in
accordance with the moratorium;
and
Whereas, this Council believes
that re-authorizing full enforcement
of section 551.111 is necessary to
address the problems associated
with setting out excessive waste;
and

The City Record
Whereas, this Council believes
that after review during the moratorium period, the Department of
