An emergency resolution designating old Detroit Avenue between
West 24th Street and Center Street
as a residential permit parking area
for Stonebridge Tower residents.
Whereas, the Director of Public
Safety has received verified petitions by residents living in eighty
percent (80%) of the living units in
the area of old Detroit Avenue
between West 24th Street and Center Street; and
Whereas, the Director of Public
Safety has completed a survey of
the above mentioned street and the
surrounding areas, has held a public hearing, and has determined that
the number of off-street parking
spaces is inadequate to accommodate Stonebridge Tower residents’
vehicles, and widespread use of
available curbside parking spaces
by non-resident vehicles results in a
lack of nearby curbside parking;
and
Whereas, the Director of Public
Safety has therefore determined that
Old Detroit Avenue between West
24th Street and Center Street is eligible for residential permit parking
and has recommended to Council
that it designate said street as a residential permit parking area; and
Whereas, Council Member McCormack concurs in the Director’s recommendation; and
Whereas,

objective criteria set forth in Chapter 461 of the Codified Ordinances of

A. Purpose of the Police Review
Board
1. The purpose of these procedures
is to facilitate the operation of the
Civilian
Police
Review
Board
(“CPRB”), including the review of
public
complaints
filed
against
sworn police officers and non-sworn
employees who are employed by the
Cleveland Division of Police as
authorized by the City of Cleveland
Charter (§§ 115-3, 115-4).
2. In order for this purpose to be
achieved, the Civilian Police Review
Board, hereafter referred to as the
Board or the CPRB, shall have the
power to receive, cause investigation of, and recommend, and in some
cases determine, the resolution of
public complaints regarding misconduct allegedly committed by employees of the Cleveland Division of
Police (“CDP”).
B. Purpose, Scope, and Force of
this Operating Manual
1. In addition to the Cleveland
Charter, this Operating Manual contains all of the rules, procedures,
processes, and general operations of
the CPRB. If rules, procedures,
processes, or operations codified
elsewhere or functionally operational elsewhere and potentially,
apparently, and/or actually conflict
with the provisions of this Manual,
the provisions of this Manual control.
2. All provisions of this Operating
Manual must be considered in a
manner consistent with the Charter
of the City of Cleveland.
C. Duties and Responsibilities of
the Board, Its Members, and Staff
1. The Board, Board members, and
all Board staff must acquit themselves of the duties outlined here in
a manner that is consistent with the
following
statement
of
ethics
(adopted from the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law
Enforcement (“NACOLE”) Code of
Ethics). (See Attachment A.)
a. Members of the CPRB have a
unique role as public servants

overseeing
the
conduct
of
law
enforcement officers. The community,
government, and law enforcement
have entrusted members of the CPRB
to
conduct
their
work
in
a
professional,
fair
and
impartial
manner. This trust is earned through
a firm commitment to the public good,
the mission of the CPRB, and to the
ethical and professional standards
described herein.
b. These standards are intended to
be of general application. The spirit of these ethical and professional
standards should guide CPRB members and staff in adapting to individual circumstances, and in promoting public trust, integrity and
transparency.
c. Personal Integrity: CPRB members and staff will demonstrate the
highest
standards
of
personal
integrity, commitment, truthfulness,
and fortitude in order to inspire
trust among CPRB stakeholders,
and to set an example for others.
d. Avoid conflicts of interest:
CPRB members and staff are expected to conduct themselves in a fair
and impartial manner and recuse
themselves when significant conflicts of interest arise. CPRB members and staff will not accept gifts,
gratuities or favors that could compromise their impartiality and independence or that have a substantial
and improper influence upon the
performance of their duties. As public officials, CPRB members are
bound by the City and State ethics
laws.
e.
Independent
and
Thorough
Oversight: CPRB members and staff
are expected to conduct all evaluations and reviews with diligence, an
open and questioning mind, integrity, objectivity and fairness, and in
a timely manner. CPRB members
and staff are expected to rigorously
test the accuracy and reliability of
information from all sources and
consider and present facts and findings without regard to personal
beliefs or concern for personal, professional or political consequences.
f. Transparency and Confidentiality: CPRB members and staff are
expected to conduct their activities
openly and transparently (as permitted by applicable policy and
law), to include providing explanation of CPRB and OPS procedures
and practices to as wide an audience as possible. CPRB members
and staff must maintain the confidentiality of information that cannot
be disclosed by law and policy and
protect the security of confidential
records.
g. Respectful and Unbiased Treatment: CPRB members and staff
must treat all individuals with dignity and respect, and without preference or discrimination including
but not limited to the following protected classes: age, ethnicity, culture, race, disability, gender, gender
identity, religion, sexual orientation,
socioeconomic status or political
beliefs.
h. Outreach and Relationships
with Stakeholders: CPRB members
and staff are expected to disseminate information and conduct outreach activity in the community as
permitted by law and policy. CPRB
members and staff pursue open, candid, and non-defensive dialogue with
all stakeholders and seek to educate
and learn from the community.

872

May 23, 2018
i. Self-examination and Commitment to Policy Review: CPRB members and staff seek continuous
improvement in the effectiveness of
civilian oversight of law enforcement programs in Cleveland. CPRB
members and staff gauge their
effectiveness
through
evaluation
and analysis of their work product
and seek to emphasize policy review
aimed at substantive organizational
reforms that advance law enforcement
accountability
and
performance.
j. Professional Excellence: CPRB
members and staff seek professional development to ensure competence. CPRB members and staff
seek
to
acquire
the
necessary
knowledge and understanding of the
policies, procedures and practices of
the Cleveland Division of Police and
the Department of Safety and keep
informed of current legal, professional and social issues that affect
the community, the CDP, the Office
of Professional Standards (OPS) and
the CPRB.
k. Primary Obligation to the Community: At all times, CPRB members
and staff place their obligation to
the community, their duty to uphold
the law and the goals and objectives
of the CPRB, above personal selfinterest.

iii. All Board members shall bring
their
completed
“Pre-Meeting
Review Checklist” to the Board
meeting at which the case will be
heard.
I. Hearing Procedures

1. Purpose/Scope of Hearing
a. The Board shall hear each case
during a regularly scheduled meeting at which a quorum of members
is present.
b. The purpose of this hearing is
to review the case pursuant to the
procedures set forth in this Manual,
in order to reach a disposition and
a recommendation on discipline for
each allegation identified by OPS or
by Board members during their
review of the case.
c. The Board shall give weight to
the
OPS
Administrator’s
recommended disposition, and shall justify in writing any departure from it.
However, the Board is not bound by
the OPS Administrator’s recommendation, and shall reach its own conclusions regarding the appropriate
disposition.
2. Standard of Proof - Dispositions
a. No finding with respect to an
allegation of a case shall be sustained unless it is proven by a preponderance of the evidence. “Preponderance of the evidence” means
the greater weight of evidence; for
example, based on all of the evidence it is more likely than not that
conduct inconsistent with CDP policy,
procedure
or
training
has
occurred or has not occurred.
b. For purposes of applying the
“preponderance
of
the
evidence”
standard of proof, officer performance must be evaluated against
the policy, procedure, or training
that was in effect on the day that,
or during the relevant time period
during which, the incident occurred.
3. Standard for Recommendation
Regarding
Discipline
or
Other
Remedial Action
a. When considering a recommendation regarding discipline or other
remedial action, the Board shall

training at issue documented and
available to CDP officers or employees who were expected to follow it?
ii. Was OPS’s investigation of the
complaint complete, fair and objective?

875

iii. Was there sufficient evidence
to establish by a preponderance of
the evidence that the alleged conduct occurred and that it violated a
CDP policy, procedure or training?
iv. Is the recommended discipline
consistent with the CDP disciplinary
GPO in place at the time the conduct occurred?

4. Presentation of Findings
a. The Presentation of Findings
shall be open to the public.
b. The Presentation of Findings
shall consist of the following, which
shall be addressed in the following
order:
i. The OPS investigator who was
assigned the case and completed the
OPS investigator’s summary shall
provide a list of the allegations
investigated by OPS, a summary of
their investigation, and the OPS
Administrator’s findings and conclusions to the Board. This summary
will not necessarily inventory all
evidence and investigatory material
but should, at minimum, outline the
nature of the complaint, the nature
of the allegations involved, and the
material evidence and facts established by the investigation.
ii. Following the investigator’s
summary, Board members shall pose
any questions they may have for
OPS relating to the investigation or
the findings and conclusions.
5. Executive Session
a. Following the presentation of
the cases, the Board shall go into
Executive Session if required by law
and may go into Executive Session
upon the request of any Board member if permissible by law. During
discussions and deliberations that
occur in Executive Session, no individuals or entities who are not

OPS Administrator or his or her
designee to remain during executive
session deliberations on cases in
order to provide advice and consult.

public session only (1) upon completion of consideration of all issues
listed in paragraph I.6.c for a case,
and (2) upon motion by the Chair or
another Board Member.
b. Board members have both an
opportunity and a duty to provide
the OPS investigator with written
questions about investigated cases
prior to Board meetings and may
also ask the investigator questions
during the Presentation of Findings
that occurs before an Executive Session. If questions or issues nonetheless arise for the first time during
an Executive Session, the Board
may, on motion by the Chair or
another Board member, vote on
tabling deliberation and/or adjudication of a case in order to pose the
question(s) or issue(s) to OPS. The
Board may return to public session
to make additional inquiries of OPS
and then return to conclude its
deliberations
immediately
thereafter.
i. If deliberation or consideration
of any case is tabled in order for
the Board to follow up with an OPS
investigator on a question or issue,
the deliberation or consideration of
that case will continue at the earliest opportunity, or in any event no

34
later than at the start of the Board’s
next meeting, whether regularlyscheduled or otherwise.

6. Board Discussions
a. For cases to be heard by the
entire Board, the Chair shall begin
the discussion of the case. The goal
of this discussion is to allow each
Board member to reach a conclusion,
by a preponderance of evidence,
regarding the appropriate case disposition.
b. For cases to be heard by a
three-member panel, the Panel Chair
shall begin the discussion of the
case. Hearings on cases assigned to
three-member panels will be completed in the same manner as full
Board hearings.
c. Board or panel’s discussion
shall address the following questions:
i. Findings and evidence that tend
to support OPS’s recommendation;
ii. Findings and evidence that
tend to not support OPS’s recommendation;
iii.
The
relevant
case
law,
statutes, and CDP policies, procedures and training;
iv. Whether the OPS investigation
tends to support the allegation by a
preponderance of the evidence. The
“preponderance
of
the
evidence”
means that, based on all of the evidence, it is more likely than not that
a violation has occurred;
v. Individual Board member recommendations.
d. The Board shall conclude the
deliberation of each case only (1)
upon consideration of all issues listed above, and (2) upon motion by
the Chair or another Board Member.
7. Adjudication of Cases
a. After consideration of each
case, the Board shall move into the
voting process.
b. Categories of Dispositions
i. The Board shall vote on a recommendation of one of the following findings for each allegation:
1. Sustained: Preponderance of the
evidence supports a finding that the
alleged conduct occurred and the
officer’s actions were inconsistent
with law or CDP policy, procedure,
or training. A complaint may be
“sustained in part” if the investigation revealed sufficient evidence to
support a finding of a policy violation on one or more, but not all of
the complainant’s allegations. A
complaint may also be “sustained
for a violation not based on original
complaint”
if
the
investigation
reveals evidence of misconduct that
was
not
included
in
the
complainant’s original allegation but
arose out of the incident that is the
subject of the complaint.
2. Exonerated: Preponderance of
the evidence supports a finding that
the alleged conduct occurred but the
officer’s actions were consistent
with law or CDP policy, procedure
or training.
3. Unfounded: Preponderance of
the evidence supports a finding that
the alleged conduct did not occur.
4. Insufficient Evidence: Preponderance of the evidence fails to
establish whether or not the conduct
occurred.
c. Standard for Disposition:
i. The Board shall apply the “preponderance of evidence” standard of
proof, set forth in Section (I)(2), to
each and all of the allegations identified in the investigative file.

The City Record
d. Voting
i. Disposition votes shall be public.
ii. Decisions of the Board shall be
made by majority vote.
iii. If a majority vote cannot be
achieved, the Board will recess the
case until its next meeting and
deliberate anew.

8. Recommendations Regarding
Discipline or Other Remedial Action
a. Where the Board reaches an
adjudication of “Sustained” on one
or more allegations, the Board will
subsequently deliberate on a recommendation
regarding
appropriate
discipline or other remedial action.
b. Potential discipline and other
remedial actions include re-training,
a letter of reinstruction, counseling
from a supervisor, suspension, demotion, termination, or other action
that may be appropriate to address
the violation.
c. To determine the recommended
discipline action, the Board shall
refer to the relevant Disciplinary
GPO and/or other relevant General
Police Orders addressing discipline,
re-training, supervisory intervention,
or other remedial action for misconduct or deficient performance. The
Board shall make recommendations
consistent with, and not materially
deviating from, the Discipline GPO
and/or other relevant General Police
Orders.
d.
e. In its deliberations on its disciplinary
recommendations,
the
Board will determine the disciplinary
group
of
the
disciplinary
matrix to be recommended to the
Chief of Police or the Director of
Public Safety. In unusual cases
where the Board concludes that the
discipline imposed should be at the
high or low end of the range of the
disciplinary matrix group, the Board
may recommend a specific disciplinary outcome such as a specific
number of days suspension to be
served, termination or demotion, or
other disciplinary or non-disciplinary action (such as verbal counseling, letter of re-instruction or
remedial training).
f. The Board shall conclude the
deliberation regarding discipline or
other remedial action only upon
motion by the Chair or another
Board Member.
g. Voting
i. Disposition votes regarding discipline shall be public.
ii. Decisions of the Board regarding recommendations on discipline
or other remedial action shall be
made by majority vote. In the event
a majority of the Board cannot
agree on a particular level of discipline, the Board Secretary will prepare an explanation of the votes
cast by each Board member for the
Board’s final summary.
9.
Recommendation
Regarding
Training/Policy Changes
a. In addition to recommending
discipline or other remedial action
for CDP officers and employees, the
Board shall also consider whether a
complaint suggests that CDP should
revise its policies, strategies, tactics,
or training.
b. If so, its Final Summary shall
so indicate.

876

May 23, 2018
10. Recommendation Regarding
Commendations
a. During review and consideration of investigations, Board members may identify officer or employee performance that is commendable, superior, noteworthy, or otherwise deserving of special and positive recognition. In such circumstances, a Board member may move
that the Board issue a commendation.
b. If a majority of the Board votes
to approve the motion, the Board’s
Chair will provide a written commendation of the identified officer
or employee’s performance to the
Chief of Police and Director of Public Safety.
11. Final Summary
a. Board staff, under the direction
of the Chair or designee, shall prepare a Final Summary with respect
to each case or matter under consideration which shall include: the
names of Board or panel members
who reviewed the case; the final
vote for each recommended disposition; an explanation that outlines
with sufficient detail (1) the relevant case law, statutes, and CDP
policies and procedures, (2) evidence supporting the Board’s recommendation, and (3) justification
for any departure from OPS’s recommended disposition; if any disposition is “sustained,” the Board’s recommendation regarding discipline
or other remedial action. If there is
a recommendation regarding discipline or other remedial action, the
following statement: In reaching
this recommendation, the Board has
determined that it is consistent with
CDP’s disciplinary matrix.”
b.
The
Final
Summary
shall
include the Board’s disposition and,
where applicable, recommended discipline or other remedial action, and
a brief outline of the evidence that
the Board concluded tended to support the disposition and/or recommendation. If the Board’s recommended disposition departs from
OPS’s recommended disposition, the
Final Summary shall also include a
written justification for the departure. The Summary may also include
a recommendation that the incident
suggests that CDP should revise its
policies, strategies, tactics, or training.
J. Special Procedures for Administrative Dismissal

1. Assignment of Cases
a. On an interim basis, cases in
which OPS has initiated a disposition of “Administrative Dismissal”
shall be reviewed by the Board upon
a
timely
request
for
review
(“appeal”) by a complainant. In
order to facilitate this process, OPS
shall include in every disposition
letter where a complaint has been
administratively dismissed, notice to
the complainant of their right to
request a review by the Board within 15 days of the date of receipt of
the OPS notice.
b. For each appeal, a three-member panel shall be chosen by the
Chair in accord with Section H.2. of
this Manual. Each panel member
shall review the Administrative Dismissal Form prepared by OPS, to
determine whether the undisputed
facts support the ground(s) for
administrative dismissal.

May 23, 2018
c. If the Panel members unanimously determine that the undisputed facts support the ground(s)
for administrative dismissal, the
Panel Chair shall check the box on
the Administrative Dismissal Form
stating that they concur with OPS’s
recommendation, sign and date the
form, and return it to OPS. OPS will
then notify the complainant of the
completion of the Board’s review.
d. If any Panel member determines that the undisputed facts do
not support the grounds for administrative dismissal, or that the case
requires further investigation, the
appeal will be referred to the entire
Board for a hearing and decision at
its next meeting. If the Board, by a
majority vote, determines that the
undisputed facts do not support the
grounds
for
administrative
dismissal, or that the case requires further investigation, the case will be
returned to OPS for investigation.
e. During the pendency of the Consent Decree between the United
States
and
City
of
Cleveland
addressing the performance of the
Cleveland Division of Police, ongoing reviews and audits of the
Administrative
Dismissal
process
will be conducted by the Monitoring
Team to ensure compliance with
OPS
policies
and
the
Consent
Decree.

2. Eligibility for Administrative
Dismissal
i. Only the following types of complaints may be Administratively Dismissed:
a. Complaints disputing traffic
citations, except that allegations of
misconduct contained in such complaints (e.g., racial profiling, illegal
search, excessive force) will be classified and investigated according to
their merits;
b. Complaints alleging a delay in
police services where the preliminary
investigation
demonstrates
that the delay was due to workload,
or was otherwise unavoidable;
c. Complaints regarding off-duty
conduct, unless the employee is
working secondary employment, or
the alleged conduct, or its effects,
are inconsistent with law or CDP
policy, procedure, or training or
have a substantial nexus to the officer's City employment; and
d. Complaints in which the preliminary investigation demonstrates
that the officer was not an employee of CDP at the time the conduct
occurred, or where the identity of
the employee cannot be determined
despite the best efforts of OPS.
ii. Complaints that allege other
types of conduct cannot be disposed
of via the Administrative Dismissal
process.
K. Post-Hearing Procedures

1. Notice to Complainant and Subject CDP Employee
a. Upon completion of every hearing, the Board shall cause OPS to
notify the complainant and each
subject CDP employee. The notice
shall contain written notice that the
complaint was considered by the
Board and the date of that hearing;
and an explanation of the process
utilized by the Board.
b. The notice shall include:
i. The date, time and location of
the hearing.

The City Record
ii. The nature of the Board’s conclusions and recommendations
iii. An explanation of the evidence
that both tended to support and
tended not to support the conclusion.
iv. Information on whether there
will be further proceedings related
to the complaint, such as referral of
the matter to the Chief of Police or
Director of Public Safety for a hearing and possible imposition of discipline
c. OPS shall use best efforts to
contact the complainant and subject
employees, including:
i. Sending a letter via United
States Postal Service to the last
known address of the complainant;
ii. Providing written notice to the
subject employees through the subject officers’ command staff or the
subject employee’s supervisor; and
iii. Electronic mail to the parties,
when feasible.
d. OPS shall make record of
notices sent and keep the Board
advised of its actions in that regard.

2. Forwarding of Recommendation
to Chief of Police
a. Upon completion of a hearing,
the CPRB shall deliver its Final
Summary prepared for each complaint adjudicated as “Sustained” to
the Chief of Police and/or the Director of Public Safety, as appropriate,
within fourteen calendar days.
b. The Chief or Director of Public
Safety shall hold a due process hearing, as required by law, at which
involved officers may present testimony or other evidence.
L. Action Following Hearing by
the Chief/Director of Public Safety

1. Notice to the CPRB of Hearing
Outcome
a. Within 10 days of the conclusion of a hearing, the Chief or Director of Public Safety will notify the
Board of the outcome, including the
disposition of the charges and any
discipline imposed.
b. If the disposition or discipline
departs from the Board’s recommendation, the Chief or Director of Public Safety will provide a written
explanation for this departure.
2. Overriding Departure by the
Chief of Police
a. In cases involving Board recommended discipline of a suspension of 10 working days or less,
where the Chief of Police departs
from the Board’s disposition or recommendation regarding discipline
or other outcome, the Board will
consider whether to override the
departure pursuant to the City Charter (sections 115-1 through 115-4).
b. The Chair of the Board will present the Chief’s decision at the first
CPRB meeting following receipt of
the written explanation for the
departure. If any member of the
Board believes that, notwithstanding the Chief’s determination, a preponderance of the evidence establishes misconduct, and that there is
just cause for the Board’s original
recommendation
regarding
discipline or other remedial consequence,
including suspension, demotion or
termination, then the Board member
shall move the Chair for reconsideration of the matter by the full
Board.
c. A case shall be reconsidered,
and the discipline determination

877

35
reviewed, if and only if a majority
of the Board’s permanent members
votes to re-consider the case.
d. At the reconsideration of the
case before the Board, the procedures, processes, and standards for
governing the Board’s initial review
of the case govern, with the exception that Board members must consider (i) whether the evidence and
explanation for departure tends to
support or tends to not support the
Chief of Police’s determination, and
(ii) whether there is still just cause
to make a finding and/or impose
discipline in light of the explanation
for the departure. CPRB members
must closely review and consider
the disciplinary letter and other
materials provided to it by the
Chief, to include the content of any
evidence presented at the Chief’s
Hearing with the subject employee.
e. For the Board to impose its
original finding on any allegation
where the Chief has determined not
to do so, a majority of the Board’s
permanent members must vote that
a preponderance of evidence supports the original recommendation.
f. For the Board to impose its original recommendation of discipline or
other remedial action where the
Chief has determined not to do so or
where the Chief has determined to
impose a different term of suspension, two-thirds of the Board’s permanent members must vote that
there is just cause to impose its
original recommendation regarding
suspension and/or the term of suspension.
g. If the Board votes to impose its
original adjudication and/or recommendation regarding discipline or
other remedial action, the Board
shall prepare an Amended Final
Summary explaining its rationale.
The Board’s Administrative Coordinator will send the Amended Final
Summary to the Director of Public
Safety with a copy to the Chief. The
Amended Final Summary will constitute a formal certification in writing of the Board’s determination, to
the Chief of Police and the Director
of Public Safety.
h. The Director of Public Safety is
the ultimate adjudicator of discipline for CDP. If the Director does
not accept the decision of the CPRB,
s/he will provide a written explanation for this decision to the Chair.

3. Notice to Complainant and Subject CDP Employee
i. Within ten days of receiving
notice that the Chief or Director of
Public Safety has determined to
impose the Board’s adjudication and
recommended discipline, the CPRB
shall cause OPS to notify the complainant
and
the
subject
CDP
employee(s).
ii. When the Chief or the Director
of Public Safety has determined to
depart from the Board’s adjudication
and/or recommended discipline, and
the Board does not reconsider this
determination, the Board shall cause
OPS to notify the complainant and
the subject CDP employee(s) no
later than ten days following its
next regular meeting. This notice
shall include the Board’s reasoning
for not reconsidering the Chief’s
determination.
iii. When the Chief has determined to depart from the Board’s
adjudication and/or recommended

The City Record

36
discipline, and the Board reconsiders this determination, the Board
shall cause OPS to notify the complainant and the subject employee(s) of the outcome within ten
days following the meeting at which
reconsideration took place.
iv. In all cases adjudicated by the
Board, the Board will direct OPS to
provide a timely written explanation
to the complainant and the subject
employee(s) outlining the reasoning
behind the Board’s decision to issue
findings of “insufficient evidence,”
“unfounded” or “exonerated.”

1. The rules contained within this
Operating Manual, and the procedures and rules outlined here, may

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 631-18.
By Council Member Bishop.
An emergency resolution objecting to a New C1 Liquor Permit at
3643 East 116th Street.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Division of Liquor Control of an application for a New C1
Liquor Permit at Waheeb Zahriyeh,
DBA Kwick Food Shop, 3643 East
116th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44105,
Permit Number 9345590; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed

The City Record
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Superintendent of Liquor Control within 30
days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to a New C1
Liquor Permit at Waheeb Zahriyeh,
DBA Kwick Food Shop, 3643 East
116th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44105,
Permit
Number
9345590,
and
requests
the
Superintendent
of
Liquor Control to set a hearing for
said application in accordance with
provisions of Section 4303.26 of the
Revised Code of Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two
copies of a letter requesting that the
hearing be held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force

SUMMARY FOR THE LEGISLATIVE FILE
Playhouse Square Tower
East 17th/Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44115
Playhouse Square
Robin Brown
3 - McCormack
Non-School TIF

Project Summary and Discussion
Playhouse Square Foundation or designee, (“Developer”) is proposing to develop a 34-story, 315-unit residential
tower on the existing parking lot at the Southwest corner of E. 17th & Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44115 (“Project Site”). The project would consist of a 4-story 550-space parking garage with residential use above. The first
floor of the garage would include space that could be developed for retail if a substantial and viable tenant
emerges. In order to assist with the project financing, Playhouse Square has requested the City impose a 5709.41,
30-Year, Non-school TIF. The TIF will support debt service related to the project and assist with the development
of the residential tower and garage. The project will create and/or cause to create 10 new W-2 jobs at the Project Site. Estimated value of TIF is $4,200,000.
Playhouse has been working on this project for several years. They view this project as a key element to the
revitalization of the Playhouse Square district, providing a crowning building to anchor the eastern end of the
district before giving way to the CSU Campus. In order to advance the project, Playhouse has been selling and
refinancing its real estate holdings in order to generate the substantial cash on-hand to invest in this project.
The project will remove a low-quality surface parking lot from the downtown area and is expected to attract
over 300 new residents and create 10 jobs in downtown.
Proposed City Assistance
• This ordinance will authorize the Director of Economic Development to enter into a 30-year non-school Tax
Increment Finance (TIF) agreement with Playhouse Square Foundation and/or its designee. The City will

885

The City Record

44

May 23, 2018

have declared certain improvements with respect to the project to be a public purpose and exempt 100% of
the improvements from real property taxes.
• The Developer agrees to make certain improvements to the parcel and make payments in lieu of taxes
(PILOTs) equal to the taxes that would have been paid for the parcel but for the TIF. A portion of the
PILOTs will be paid to the Cleveland Metropolitan School District in the amount the District would have otherwise received but for the TIF by the County (“District Payments”). The balance of the PILOTS will be
utilized to fund eligible project costs and project debt. The developer will be responsible for any shortfall
of PILOT payments for project costs.
• The TIF will be immediately effective on the residential tower and new parking garage after the expiration of the 15-year tax abatement for new residential construction.
Economic Impact/Justification
• Estimated 10 FTE ($288,000 annual payroll)
• Once stabilized, the project is expected to generate approximately $800,772.22 in annual property taxes for
the School District upon expiration of the residential tax abatement.
• Over the 30-year term of the TIF, the project is expected to generate approximately $10,766,250 in residence
taxes and $216,000 in income taxes for the City.
• Construction of new downtown tower is critical to demonstrate to the market that these developments are
feasible.
• Lack of new construction housing in downtown
• Serves as anchor to Euclid Avenue at CSU/Playhouse Square

activities as defined in Section
630.01 have occurred on separate
occasions within any six (6) month
period on the same property, may
cause a written notice and order to
be served on the owner of the property declaring that the property is a
nuisance property. This notice and
order shall identify the nuisance
activities, and the estimated costs to
abate any future nuisance activity;
shall state that the owner may
avoid being charged the costs of
abatement by taking steps to prevent any further nuisance activity
as set forth in division (d) of this
section; and shall state the appeal
process. The notice shall further
state that if a fourth or subsequent
nuisance activity as defined in Section 630.01 occurs later than thirteen
(13) days after the date of the written nuisance declaration notice and
within six (6) months of the date of
the third or any subsequent nuisance activity, the City may abate
the nuisance by responding to the
activities using administrative and
law enforcement actions, and the
costs of the abatement shall be
charged to the owner of the nuisance property and may be certified
as a lien on the nuisance property.
Notice shall be deemed properly
delivered by delivering it personally to the owner or leaving it at the
owner’s usual place of business or
residence, or by mailing it to the
owner, or by publishing it once in a
newspaper of general circulation
within the City, or by posting it in
a conspicuous place on the real
estate involved. The notice shall
also set forth the civil fines if a
fifth or any subsequent nuisance
activity occurs within six months of
the date of the notice of a charge
for the cost of abatement issued
under division (b) of this section.
(b) Abatement. If the Director of
Public Safety or his or her designee
determines that a fourth or subsequent nuisance activity as defined
in Section 630.01 occurs later than
thirteen (13) days after the date of
the initial written nuisance declaration notice and within six (6)
months after the date of the third
or any subsequent nuisance activity,
the City may abate the nuisance
activity by using administrative and
law enforcement actions, and the
costs of the abatement shall be
charged to the owner of the property and, if not paid, may be certified
by the Commissioner of Assessments
and Licenses to the County Auditor
to be placed on the nuisance property as a lien to be collected as
other taxes and returned to the City.

The cost to abate the nuisance activity shall be calculated as set forth
in division (c). The City shall provide notice to the owner of the nuisance property of the City’s decision
to charge the cost of abatement. If
the costs are not paid by the owner,
the City shall notify the owner at
least thirty (30) days before the
costs are certified to the County
Auditor. The notice shall contain a
street address or legal description of
the property, a description of the
nuisance activities and the cost to
abate. Notices shall be served as set
forth in division (a) of this section.
The Director of Law may take any
other action necessary to collect the
costs of abatement.
(c) Costs of Abatement. Costs of
abatement
shall
be
determined
based on the time required to
respond to the nuisance activity
multiplied by an hourly rate based
upon the wages and benefits of a
police officer, dispatch costs, vehicle
and equipment costs, and supervisory and administrative costs. The
hourly rate may be adjusted based
on the number of police officers
required to abate the nuisance.
(d) Nuisance Abatement Plan. The
owner of a nuisance property may
avoid being charged the cost of
abating future nuisances if the
owner meets with the Director of
Public Safety or his or her designee;
presents a plan to prevent further
nuisance activity and that plan is
approved by the Director of Public
Safety or his or her designee; and
implements the plan.
(e) Civil Fine. If the Director of
Public Safety or his or her designee
determines that a fifth or subsequent nuisance activity as defined
in Section 630.01 occurs within 6
months after the date of the notice
of a charge for the cost of abatement, a property owner shall be
charged
five
hundred
dollars
($500.00) for a fifth nuisance activity, seven hundred fifty dollars
($750.00) for a sixth nuisance activity
and
one
thousand
dollars
($1,000.00) for a seventh or any subsequent nuisance activity occurring
on the same property. This fine is
in addition to the costs of abatement
that may be charged and, if the fine
is not paid, shall be certified to the
County Auditor as set forth in division (b) of this section. Fines are
subject to appeal as set forth in
division (f) of this section.
(f) Appeal. The owner of a nuisance
property
who
receives
a
notice declaring the owner’s property to be a nuisance property, a
notice charging the cost of abating
nuisance activity, a notice that the
cost of abatement shall be certified
to the County Auditor, a notice
charging a fine for a fifth or subsequent nuisance activity, or a
notice that a fine shall be certified
to the County Auditor, may appeal
the notice by submitting a written
request to the City official who
issued the notice within ten (10)
days of the date of the notice. If,
after a decision on that appeal, the
owner disagrees with the decision,
the owner may appeal the decision
of the City official to the Board of
Zoning Appeals. An appeal to the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall be
made within fifteen (15) days of the
postmark date of the decision from
the City official denying the appeal.
The Board shall conduct a hearing

54
and render a decision in accordance
with City ordinances and regulations governing its conduct and procedure. An appeal to the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall not stay any
actions by the City to abate any subsequent nuisance activity. In any
appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals the City must show by a
preponderance of the evidence that
there was probable cause to believe
that each nuisance activity stated in
the
notice
being
appealed
has
occurred, and that the declaration of
the property as a nuisance property
is justified, or that the charging of
abatement costs and fines, if applicable, or the certification of abatement costs and fines, if applicable,
is justified. The owner may prevail
on appeal of any notice if the owner
demonstrates by a preponderance of
the evidence that:
(1) He or she was not the owner
at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the
notice; or
(2) He or she had knowledge of
the nuisance activity, but promptly
and vigorously took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance activity
including,
without
limitation,
compliance with the requirements of
RC 5321.17(C) and RC 5321.04(A)(9);
or
(3) He or she had no knowledge
of the nuisance activity and could
not, with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance
activity; and upon receipt of the
notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance property, he or
she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance including, without limitation, compliance
with
the
requirements
of
RC
5321.17(C) and RC 5321.04(A)(9).
