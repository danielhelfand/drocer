FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 410-17.
By Council Members Keane and

An
emergency
ordinance
authorizing the Director of Port

renew Contract No. CT 3001 PS 2015-102
with AvAirPros Services, Inc. to
provide maintenance, operation, and
management
of
the
City-owned

Whereas, under the authority of
Ordinance No. 466-14, passed May 12,
2014, the Director of Port Control
entered into Contract No. CT 3001 PS
2015-102 with AvAirPros Services,
Inc. to provide maintenance, operation, and management of the Cityowned common use facilities at
Cleveland
Hopkins
International
Airport; and
Whereas, Ordinance No. 466-14
requires further legislation before
exercising the first option to renew
on this contract; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Port Control is authorized to exercise the first option to renew Contract No. CT 3001 PS 2015-102 for an
additional year with AvAirPros Services, Inc. to provide maintenance,
operation, and management of the

the additional legislative authority
required by Ordinance No. 466-14 to
exercise this option.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and,
provided
it
receives
the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from

Ord. No. 411-17.
By Council Member Kelley (by

Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $18,500,000
(the “Series 2017 Bonds”) to finance
the
costs
of
certain
permanent
improvements described in Section 1;
and

Whereas, the Series 2017 Bonds
shall be payable from and secured
by income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made
to the escrow agent for the City’s
general obligation bonds; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Series 2017
Bonds is at least five years and the
maximum maturity of the Series
2017 Bonds is 29 years, as evidenced
by the certificate contained in File
No. 411-17-A; and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Series 2017 Bonds is
necessary to provide funds to pay
the
costs
of
certain
permanent
improvements described in Section 1
that are urgently needed for the
benefit of the City, and as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety, and for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Series 2017
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed $18,500,000 for

issuance of the securities, including
all financing costs within the meaning of Section 133.01(K) of the

is paid at the rate or rates per year
specified in the Certificate of Award,
provided that the yield (determined in
accordance
with
the
arbitrage
provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended) of the Series
2017 Bonds shall not exceed 6% per
year, if sold as fixed rate obligations.
Interest on the Series 2017 Bonds shall
be payable semi-annually on April 1
and October 1, or such other dates
specified in the Certificate of Award
(the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The provisions of Sections  9.98 to
9.983 of the Revised Code shall apply
to the Series 2017 Bonds and pursuant
to that authority and this Ordinance,
the
Director
of
Finance
may
determine in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, that the City’s best
interests will be served by causing all
or a portion of the Series 2017 Bonds to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds shall
be determined; provided that the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds shall
not bear interest at a rate in excess of
25% per year. The Director of Finance
is authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds, and
from time to time thereafter so long as
the variable rate Series 2017 Bonds are

The City Record
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, to be necessary or
appropriate to provide for the method
of determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right of
tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds upon
tender for purchase or redemption,
and providing for the repayment by
the City of any amounts drawn under
the Credit Support Instrument.
The Series 2017 Bonds shall mature
in the years and principal amounts set
forth in the Certificate of Award,
provided that (i) each principal
payment shall occur on an Interest
Payment Date, and (ii)  the final
maturity date of the Series 2017 Bonds
shall be no later than August 1, 2048;
provided that the Series 2017 Bonds
shall not have more than 29 annual
principal installments. The Series 2017
Bonds stated to mature in any year
may be issued as serial Series 2017
Bonds or as term Series 2017 Bonds
payable prior to stated maturity
pursuant to sinking fund redemption
(the “Term Bonds”). The Director of
Finance shall determine in the
Certificate of Award whether any of
the Series 2017 Bonds shall be issued
as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking
fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal
to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements”).
If any of the Series 2017 Bonds are
issued as Term Series 2017 Bonds, the
Term Bonds shall be redeemed
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements at a
redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount redeemed, plus
interest accrued to the redemption
date, on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates. The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Trustee for
payment of principal of and interest
on any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements (less the amount of any
credit as provided in the Indenture
and the Ninth Supplement).
The Series 2017 Bonds may be
subject
to
redemption
prior
to
maturity by and at the option of the
City, in whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
redemption
dates
and
at
the
redemption prices specified in the
Certificate of Award, plus, in each
case,
accrued
interest
to
the
redemption date. Based on the written
advice of a financial advisor, the
Director of Finance may determine in
the Certificate of Award that it is in
the best interests of the City (i) for
some or all of the Series 2017 Bonds not
to be callable prior to their stated
maturity, and (ii) for a premium to be
payable on the redemption of any
Series 2017 Bonds calculated in a
manner to make the bondholder whole
for the loss of the investment or
calculated as a percentage in excess of
100%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed.

If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the City may
have the option to purchase any Bond
which is redeemable by optional

date of the proposed purchase. That
election shall be exercised as provided
in the Ninth Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the Series 2017
Bonds may be secured by a Debt

amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director
of Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”). The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund or

Section 3. Pledge and Covenant to
Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate
to the lien granted in the General Bond
Ordinance as security for the General
Obligation Bonds of the City issued
and outstanding under the General
Bond Ordinance, to the full extent
required to meet debt charges payable
on the Bonds issued and outstanding,
from time to time, under the Indenture.
The City covenants to appropriate
annually sufficient amounts from the
income taxes to pay all debt charges
on the General Obligation Bonds, the
Bonds
outstanding
under
the
Indenture, any Parity Obligations and
the
Unrestricted
Income
Tax
Obligations (each as defined in the
Indenture).
The
City
further
covenants that so long as any Bonds
are outstanding under the Indenture,
the City shall not repeal or amend, or
suffer the repeal of, any ordinance for
the levy or collection of its income
taxes in any manner or to such extent
that the City would not be able to meet
its obligations to the holders of the
Bonds.
Section 4. Terms of the Series 2017
Bonds. The Series 2017 Bonds shall be
issued in fully registered form. The
Series 2017 Bonds may be issued in one
or more series or subseries. The Series
2017 Bonds may be delivered only in
book-entry form, and if so delivered,
shall be registered in the name of the
Depository
(as
defined
in
the
Indenture)
or
its
nominee,
as
registered owner, and immobilized in
the custody of the Depository, and

not
be
transferable
or

without further action by the City

identified in Section 7. The Series 2017

Certificate of Award identified below.
The Series 2017 Bonds shall be issued
in one lot as fully registered Series
2017 Bonds in denominations of $5,000
or any whole multiple thereof. The
Series 2017 Bonds shall be numbered
as determined by the Director of
Finance. The Series 2017 Bonds shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture.
The Series 2017 Bonds shall be dated
the date of their issuance and delivery
or such other date specified in the
certificate of award providing for the
final terms of the Series 2017 Bonds
and the sale of the Series 2017 Bonds in
accordance with this Ordinance (the
“Certificate of Award”). The Series
2017 Bonds shall bear interest from
their date until the principal amount
is paid at the rate or rates per year
specified in the Certificate of Award,

April 19, 2017
provided that the yield (determined in
accordance
with
the
arbitrage
provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended) of the Series
2017 Bonds shall not exceed 6% per
year, if sold as fixed rate obligations.
Interest on the Series 2017 Bonds shall
be payable semi-annually on April 1
and October 1, or such other dates
specified in the Certificate of Award
(the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The provisions of Sections  9.98 to
9.983 of the Revised Code shall apply
to the Series 2017 Bonds and pursuant
to that authority and this Ordinance,
the
Director
of
Finance
may
determine in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, that the City’s best
interests will be served by causing all
or a portion of the Series 2017 Bonds to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds shall
be determined; provided that the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds shall
not bear interest at a rate in excess of
25% per year. The Director of Finance
is authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds, and
from time to time thereafter so long as
the variable rate Series 2017 Bonds are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, to be necessary or
appropriate to provide for the method
of determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right of
tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds upon
tender for purchase or redemption,
and providing for the repayment by
the City of any amounts drawn under
the Credit Support Instrument.
The Series 2017 Bonds shall mature
in the years and principal amounts set
forth in the Certificate of Award,
provided that (i) each principal
payment shall occur on an Interest
Payment Date, and (ii)  the final
maturity date of the Series 2017 Bonds
shall be no later than August 1, 2031;
provided that the Series 2017 Bonds
shall not have more than 12 annual
principal installments. The Series 2017
Bonds stated to mature in any year
may be issued as serial Series 2017
Bonds or as term Series 2017 Bonds
payable prior to stated maturity
pursuant to sinking fund redemption
(the “Term Bonds”). The Director of
Finance shall determine in the
Certificate of Award whether any of
the Series 2017 Bonds shall be issued
as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking
fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal
to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements”).
If any of the Series 2017 Bonds are
issued as Term Series 2017 Bonds, the
Term Bonds shall be redeemed
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements at a
redemption price of 100% of the

The City Record
principal amount redeemed, plus
interest accrued to the redemption
date, on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates. The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Trustee for
payment of principal of and interest
on any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements (less the amount of any
credit as provided in the Indenture
and the Ninth Supplement).
The Series 2017 Bonds may be
subject
to
redemption
prior
to
maturity by and at the option of the
City, in whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
redemption
dates
and
at
the
redemption prices specified in the
Certificate of Award, plus, in each
case,
accrued
interest
to
the
redemption date. Based on the written
advice of a financial advisor, the
Director of Finance may determine in
the Certificate of Award that it is in
the best interests of the City (i) for
some or all of the Series 2017 Bonds not
to be callable prior to their stated
maturity, and (ii) for a premium to be
payable on the redemption of any
Series 2017 Bonds calculated in a
manner to make the bondholder whole
for the loss of the investment or
calculated as a percentage in excess of
100%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the City may
have the option to purchase any Bond
which is redeemable by optional
redemption at a purchase price not
less than the redemption price that
would be payable if that Bond were
called for optional redemption on the
date of the proposed purchase. That
election shall be exercised as provided
in the Ninth Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the Series 2017
Bonds may be secured by a Debt
Service Reserve Fund to be held by the
Trustee under the Indenture. The
principal amount of the Series 2017
Bonds may include provision for
funding the Debt Service Reserve
Fund from the proceeds of the Series
2017 Bonds, subject to compliance with
applicable federal tax laws.
Section 5. Sale of Series 2017 Bonds.
The Series 2017 Bonds shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees of
the
Sinking

Director of Finance is authorized to
enter into agreements in connection
with the delivery of the variable rate
Notes, and from time to time thereafter
so long as the variable rate Notes are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, to be necessary or

more firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Notes and have been
selected by the Director of Finance
based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (the
“Note Purchaser”) in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director
of Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”). The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund or
funds set forth in the Note Certificate
of Award and used for the purpose for

(as
defined
in
the
Indenture)
or
its

as
registered owner, and immobilized in

identified in Section 7. The Series 2017

The Series 2017 Bonds shall be issued
in one lot as fully registered Series
2017 Bonds in denominations of $5,000
or any whole multiple thereof. The

and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture.
The Series 2017 Bonds shall be dated

or such other date specified in the
certificate of award providing for the
final terms of the Series 2017 Bonds
and the sale of the Series 2017 Bonds in
accordance with this Ordinance (the
“Certificate of Award”). The Series
2017 Bonds shall bear interest from
their date until the principal amount
is paid at the rate or rates per year
specified in the Certificate of Award,
provided that the yield (determined in
accordance
with
the
arbitrage
provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended) of the Series
2017 Bonds shall not exceed 6% per
year, if sold as fixed rate obligations.
Interest on the Series 2017 Bonds shall
be payable semi-annually on April 1
and October 1, or such other dates
specified in the Certificate of Award
(the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The provisions of Sections  9.98 to
9.983 of the Revised Code shall apply
to the Series 2017 Bonds and pursuant
to that authority and this Ordinance,
the
Director
of
Finance
may
determine in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, that the City’s best
interests will be served by causing all
or a portion of the Series 2017 Bonds to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds shall
be determined; provided that the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds shall
not bear interest at a rate in excess of
25% per year. The Director of Finance
is authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds, and
from time to time thereafter so long as
the variable rate Series 2017 Bonds are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a

April 19, 2017
financial advisor, to be necessary or
appropriate to provide for the method
of determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right of
tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of the
variable rate Series 2017 Bonds upon
tender for purchase or redemption,
and providing for the repayment by
the City of any amounts drawn under
the Credit Support Instrument.
The Series 2017 Bonds shall mature
in the years and principal amounts set
forth in the Certificate of Award,
provided that (i) each principal
payment shall occur on an Interest
Payment Date, and (ii)  the final
maturity date of the Series 2017 Bonds
shall be no later than August 1, 2036;
provided that the Series 2017 Bonds
shall not have more than 17 annual
principal installments. The Series 2017
Bonds stated to mature in any year
may be issued as serial Series 2017
Bonds or as term Series 2017 Bonds
payable prior to stated maturity
pursuant to sinking fund redemption
(the “Term Bonds”). The Director of
Finance shall determine in the
Certificate of Award whether any of
the Series 2017 Bonds shall be issued
as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking
fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal
to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements”).
If any of the Series 2017 Bonds are
issued as Term Series 2017 Bonds, the
Term Bonds shall be redeemed
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements at a
redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount redeemed, plus
interest accrued to the redemption
date, on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates. The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Trustee for
payment of principal of and interest
on any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements (less the amount of any
credit as provided in the Indenture
and the Ninth Supplement).
The Series 2017 Bonds may be
subject
to
redemption
prior
to
maturity by and at the option of the
City, in whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
redemption
dates
and
at
the
redemption prices specified in the
Certificate of Award, plus, in each
case,
accrued
interest
to
the
redemption date. Based on the written
advice of a financial advisor, the
Director of Finance may determine in
the Certificate of Award that it is in
the best interests of the City (i) for
some or all of the Series 2017 Bonds not
to be callable prior to their stated
maturity, and (ii) for a premium to be
payable on the redemption of any
Series 2017 Bonds calculated in a
manner to make the bondholder whole
for the loss of the investment or
calculated as a percentage in excess of
100%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the City may
have the option to purchase any Bond
which is redeemable by optional

The City Record
redemption at a purchase price not
less than the redemption price that
would be payable if that Bond were
called for optional redemption on the
date of the proposed purchase. That
election shall be exercised as provided
in the Ninth Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the Series 2017
Bonds may be secured by a Debt
Service Reserve Fund to be held by the
Trustee under the Indenture. The
principal amount of the Series 2017
Bonds may include provision for
funding the Debt Service Reserve
Fund from the proceeds of the Series
2017 Bonds, subject to compliance with
applicable federal tax laws.

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 431-17.
By Council Member Pruitt.
An emergency resolution supporting Senate Bill 128, and encouraging
the Ohio General Assembly to pass
this legislation to create a Zero
Emission Nuclear Resource Program
(ZEN) that preserves Ohio’s nuclear
plants in the best interest of Ohio
consumers and communities.
Whereas, Senate Bill 128 was
introduced in the Ohio Senate on
April 6, 2017, and sponsored by Senators
John
Eklund
and
Frank
LaRose; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 128 creates a
Zero Emission Nuclear Resource
Program (ZEN) that recognizes the
critical
contributions
of
nuclear
power plants in Ohio by compensating them on a per-megawatt basis
for the unique value they offer the
state; and
Whereas,
the
program
helps
assure
that
Davis-Besse
Nuclear
Power Station in Oak Harbor and
Perry Nuclear Power Plant in Perry
will continue to support well-paid
jobs, economic growth, reliable and
affordable electricity generation and
environmental progress for years to
come; and
Whereas, nuclear plants provide
the state with thousands of jobs and
millions in tax and economic benefits, as well as an environmental
advantage over natural gas and coal
generated power; in addition, instate nuclear plants minimize Ohio’s
need to import power from neighboring states, helping to keep power
costs lower for customers; and
Whereas, despite their clear benefits, many nuclear plants are facing
an uncertain future due to market
rules that do not recognize nuclear’s
total value proposition; and
Whereas, other states, such as
New York and Illinois, have recently implemented programs to protect
the unique value of nuclear plants
and ensure diverse energy resources
in their states, and Connecticut is
pursuing similar legislation; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the need for continued operation of
Ohio’s nuclear plants to enrich our
communities and the state as a
whole, and supports Senate Bill 128
to compensate Ohio’s two nuclear
plants for the clean, reliable and
secure power they generate; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Senate Bill 128, and encourages the Ohio General Assembly to
pass this legislation to create a Zero
Emission Nuclear Resource Program
(ZEN) that preserves Ohio’s nuclear
plants in the best interest of Ohio
consumers and communities.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this

resolution to David H. Turner,
External Affairs Manager, CEI, First
Energy, and Senators John Eklund
and Frank LaRose, Ohio Senate.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

this
section

as authorized by Ordinance No. 325-92
(the
“Three-Party
Agreement”),
between the City, Gateway, and the
County of Cuyahoga, Ohio (the
“County”), provided, however, that the

Arena Bonds amounts equal to the
taxes that would have been levied

exemption provided by this division
(f) at the times and in the manner that
such taxes would have been payable

the Commissioner setting forth the
amount of money actually received by
such treasurer together with the
expenses of promoting and conducting
such event. Such statement shall be
used as a basis of subsequent requests
for exemption from admissions tax in
accordance with this subsection. If
such statement demonstrates a failure
to
qualify
in
accordance
with
paragraph (1) of this subsection (g),
no such exemption shall thereafter be
allowed to such institution, society or
organization.
(h) Division (f) of this section shall
