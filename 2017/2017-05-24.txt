establish that the motor vehicle is part
of a bona fide commercial operation;

abuse,
controlled
substances,
metabolites of a controlled substance,
or a combination of them in the
defendant’s or child’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, urine, or
breath at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical
analysis of the substance withdrawn,
or specimen taken within three hours
of the time of the alleged violation.
The three-hour time limit specified in
this division regarding the admission
of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in RC

phlebotomist
shall
withdraw blood for the purpose of
determining
the
alcohol,
drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood
serum,
or
blood
plasma.
This
limitation does not apply to the taking
of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under
this division may refuse to withdraw

blood under this division if, in that
person’s opinion, the physical welfare
of the defendant or child would be
endangered by withdrawing blood.
The whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, urine, or breath withdrawn
under division (d)(1)B. of this section
shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the director of
health by an individual possessing a
valid permit issued by the director
pursuant to RC 3701.143.
(2) In a criminal prosecution or
juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) of this section
or for an equivalent offense that is
watercraft-related, if there was at the
time the bodily substance was taken a
concentration
of
less
than
the
applicable concentration of alcohol
specified for a violation of division
(a)(2), (3), (4), or (5) of this section or
less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a
listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of
division (a)(6) of this section, that
fact may be considered with other
competent evidence in determining
the guilt or innocence of the defendant
or in making an adjudication for the
child. This division does not limit or
affect a criminal prosecution or
juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (b) of this section
or for a violation of a prohibition that
is substantially equivalent to that
division.
(3) Upon the request of the person
who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available
to the person or the person’s attorney
immediately upon completion of the
test analysis.
If
the
chemical
test
was
administered pursuant to division
(d)(1) B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a
registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist of
the person’s own choosing administer
a chemical test or tests in addition to
any administered at the direction of a
law enforcement officer, and shall be
so advised. The failure or inability to
obtain an additional test by a person
shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the test or tests
taken at the direction of a law
enforcement officer.
(e)(1) In any criminal prosecution
or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this
section, or other chapter of these
Codified
Ordinances
relating
to
operating or being in physical control
of any vessel underway or to
manipulating
any
water
skis,
aquaplane, or similar device on the

under the Rules of Evidence, the court
shall admit the testimony or evidence,
and the trier of fact shall give it
whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
(2) Division (e)(1) of this section
does not limit or preclude a court, in its
determination of whether the arrest of
a person was supported by probable
cause or its determination of any other
matter in a criminal prosecution or
juvenile court proceeding of a type
described in that division, from
considering evidence or testimony
that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (e)(1) of this section.

analysis,
under
rules
of
the
department of health.
(2) Notwithstanding any other
provision of law regarding the
admission of evidence, a report of the
type described in division (f)(1) of
this section is not admissible against
the defendant or child to whom it
pertains in any proceeding, other than

authorize that the offender be granted
work release after the offender has
served the mandatory jail term of
three (3), ten (10), or thirty (30)
consecutive days that the court is
required by division (j)(1), (2), or (3)
of this section to impose. No court shall
authorize work release during the
mandatory jail term of three (3), ten
(10), or thirty (30) consecutive days
that the court is required by division
(j) (1), (2), or (3) of this section to

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 577-17.
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Cummins, Pruitt, Brady, Cleveland,
Conwell, Dow, J. Johnson, K. Johnson,
Kazy, Keane, McCormack, Mitchell,
Polensek, Reed, and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Senate to reject the proposed amendment to the state budget bill that gives the Ohio Department of Health exclusive authority
over all lead-based paint issues
statewide, and preempts Ohio cities
from taking proactive efforts to prevent lead-poisoning through local
inspection and enforcement.
Whereas, an amendment to the
Ohio budget bill, House Bill, 49,
added
by
Representative,
Derek
Merrin (R), gives the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) sole authority to regulate inspection, enforcement and abatement of led-based
paint statewide; and
Whereas, this budget bill amendment passed the Ohio House of Representatives, and if passed by the
Ohio Senate, would preempt Ohio
cities from taking proactive efforts
to prevent lead-poisoning through
local lead hazard inspections and
enforcement; and
Whereas,
as
the
amendment
stands, a city could do no more than
what the state allows, which currently involves reacting to lead poisoning cases and performing an
environmental investigation of a
home, school, or daycare after a
child has been poisoned; and
Whereas, the proposed changes
place sole responsibility for leadpaint related issues with ODH officials at a time when the department
faces major potential cuts in federal funding for training and certification of contractors to perform
lead-safe renovation and to assist
states with lead poisoning prevention, while the state dedicates little
from its own budget to lead poisoning prevention and enforcement; and
Whereas, cities such as Cleveland
and Toledo have turned to local lead
enforcement efforts, because federal
and state laws have not addressed
the problem; and
Whereas, experts, including the
National Center for Healthy Homes,
recommend local rental inspections
as a way to reduce the number of
homes in a community that pose a
risk to children from lead-based
paint hazards ; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the need for local proactive enforcement efforts to protect our children
from lead-poisoning, and urges the
Ohio Senate to reject the proposed
amendment to the state budget bill
that gives exclusive authority over
all lead-based paint issues to ODH;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

The City Record
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio Senate to reject the proposed amendment to the state budget bill that gives the Ohio Department of Health exclusive authority
over all lead-based paint issues
statewide, and preempts Ohio cities
from proactive efforts to prevent
lead-poisoning through local inspection and enforcement.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution
to
the
Ohio
Senate
members.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted May 15, 2017.
Effective May 17, 2017.

Number 8327854 to M Zayed, LLC,
DBA Snappy Gas Mart, 4189 Ridge
Road, Cleveland, Ohio 44144, Permit
Number 5377774; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.

be and she is hereby directed to

resolution, together with two copies of
a letter of objection and two copies of
a letter requesting that the hearing be
held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the

the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
