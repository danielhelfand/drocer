Project Summary and Discussion
On August 31, 2017 the Department
of
Economic
Development
issued a RFP for Mixed-Use development at the northwest corner of

E. 105th Street and Ashbury Avenue.
This development will be the first
mixed-use development supported by
a MNTI program and serve as a
starting point to connect Uptown
and Historic Wade Park to Circle
North and the rest of the Glenville
neighborhood. E. 105th Street is a
significant transit corridor and an
excellent opportunity to highlight
the community, its residents, and
local entrepreneurs.
The
Finch
Group
proposes
a
mixed use, mixed income building
over an eight parcel vacant site at
the northwest corner of E. 105th
Street and Ashbury Avenue. The
development project includes:
• 9,200 SF of co-working space for
entrepreneurs
• 4,300 SF of space reserved for a
Retail Incubator to be master
leased by Cleveland Citywide
Development Corporation
• 42,000 SF of 1- and 2-bedroom
apartment space. Rent structure
complies with City’s request for
20% of units to be lease to residents whose incomes fall within 80% of AMI
• Approximately 51 one-bedroom
apartments (17 per floor)
• Approximately 12 two-bedroom
apartments (4 per floor)
• Amenities:
approximately
63
parking
spaces,
bike-share
racks, and balconies
The
Department
of
Economic
Development is requesting approval
to enter into a non-school Tax Increment Financing agreement with The
Finch Group, or its designee, to help
the financial feasibility of the project.
The
developer
will
make
PILOT payments to use for debt service. The project is estimated to cost
$14 million and expected to be completed in June of 2019.
Developer
The Finch Group was founded in
Boston in 1981 before relocating to
Boca Raton, Florida in 1997. They
have been involved in the development and operation of over 60 properties. As of September 2017, TFG
owns and/or operates: 2,052 multifamily units (with 70 units currently
in
development),
and
25,000
square feet of retail space in Cleveland, OH (with 7,000 square feet currently in development). They have
also established an impressive track
record by applying their extensive
experience in evaluating, developing, rehabilitating, marketing, and
managing everything from affordable
multi-family
residential
to
mixed-use properties.
For this development, TFG is
working with City Architecture Inc.
and Ozanne Construction Company.
Proposed City Assistance:
The request to Cleveland City
Council is to authorize the Director
of Economic Development to enter
into a non-school Tax Increment
Finance (TIF) agreement with The
Finch Group or its designee. The
TIF proceeds will be used for debt
payments associated with the project. This TIF agreement will be up
to 30 years in length.
Under the agreement, the parcels
will
be
“TIFed”
under
section
5709.41 of the Ohio Revised Code in
consideration
for
the
developer
agreeing to make certain improvements to those parcels, and agreeing to make payments in lieu of

592

April 25, 2018
taxes (PILOT) equal to the taxes
that would have been paid for those
parcels but for the TIF. A portion

Cleveland Municipal School District
in the amount the District would
have otherwise received but for the
TIF.

The
Refunding Bonds shall be issuable
as either bonds the interest on
which is (i) excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes (the “Tax-Exempt Refunding
Bonds”), or (ii) included as gross
income for federal income tax purposes
(the
“Taxable
Refunding
Bonds”). The Director of Finance
shall determine the status of any
series of Refunding Bonds as TaxExempt Refunding Bonds or as Taxable Refunding Bonds (the “Tax
Status”), and shall designate the
applicable
series
of
Refunding
Bonds as such in the Certificate of
Award.
The Refunding Bonds shall be
dated the date and shall bear interest at the rate or rates per year

594

April 25, 2018
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, provided the weighted average of such rates per series of
Refunding
Bonds
(taking
into
account the principal amount and
maturity of each Refunding Bond to
which a rate applies) shall not
exceed 6% per year. Interest on the
Refunding Bonds shall be payable
when due, or until the principal
amount is paid, semiannually as
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the dates on which interest on
the
Refunding
Bonds
shall
be
payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”), beginning on the date specified in the Certificate of Award as
the first Interest Payment Date.
The
Refunding
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts as shall be permitted by
law and determined by the Director
of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based on (i) the
written advice of a Financial Advisor to be in the best interests of the
City given market conditions at the
time the Refunding Bonds are sold
and (ii) the objectives of the plan
of refunding to either obtain aggregate net present value debt service
savings of not less than 3% or
restructure outstanding debt of the
City.
The Director of Finance also shall
determine and certify, on or prior to
the date of delivery of the Refunding Bonds to the Original Purchaser, that portion of the aggregate
principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds that is allocable to each Project or to Final Judgments, and the
principal
amount
of
Refunding
Bonds allocated to each Project or
to Final Judgments that shall be
payable at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(as
defined below) on the applicable
principal payment dates; provided,
that (i) the aggregate principal
amount of the Refunding Bonds allocable to a Project or to Final Judgments shall be determined by the
Director of Finance on a pro rata
basis by reference to the respective
amount of funds that is required for
the
refunding
of
the
Refunded
Bonds that are allocable to that Project or to Final Judgments, taking
into account any funds other than
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds that are available and appropriated for that purpose, and (ii) no
portion of the aggregate principal
amount of Refunding Bonds allocated to a Project or to Final Judgments shall be payable later than
the maximum maturity for that portion of the Refunding Bonds as certified by the Director of Finance.
The Refunding Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued
as term bonds (the “Term Refunding Bonds”), payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements as defined and
further described below. The Director of Finance shall determine in
the Certificate of Award whether
any of the Refunding Bonds shall be
issued as Term Refunding Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Refunding
Bonds shall be payable pursuant to
mandatory
sinking
fund
installments rather than at stated maturity and the amount of principal to be
paid on each Mandatory Redemption

April 25, 2018
Date (the “Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be
subject to redemption prior to stated maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Refunding Bonds are issued as Term
Refunding Bonds, the Term Refunding Bonds shall be subject to
mandatory sinking fund redemption
and be redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements, at a redemption price
of 100% of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Refunding Bonds shall include amounts
sufficient to redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal
amount of Term Refunding Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3 hereof) for cancellation
Term
Refunding
Bonds
in
any
aggregate principal amount and to
receive a credit against the then-current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) of the City for any Term
Refunding Bonds. That option shall
be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then-current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Refunding
Bonds which prior thereto have been
redeemed (other than through the
operation of the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements) or
purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Refunding Bond so
delivered, or previously redeemed,
or purchased and canceled, shall be
credited by the Escrow Agent at
100% of the principal amount thereof against the then-current Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory redemption obligation).
Any excess of that amount over the
then-current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement shall
be
credited
against
subsequent
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligations) in the order directed by the
Director of Finance.

The City Record
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Refunding Bonds may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity by and
at the option of the City, in whole
or in part on any date, in whole multiples of $5,000, on the optional
redemption dates and at the redemption prices specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. Based on the written advice of
a financial advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the
best interests of the City for some
or all of the Refunding Bonds not
to be callable prior to their stated
maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Refunding
Bonds, or portions thereof, to be
redeemed optionally shall be selected by lot prior to the selection by
lot of the Refunding Bonds to be
redeemed on the same date by operation of the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements of
paragraph
(a).
The
Refunding
Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant
to this paragraph only upon written
notice from the Director of Finance
to the Registrar. That notice shall
specify the redemption date and the
principal amount of each maturity
of Refunding Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar.
There shall be deposited with the
Registrar on or prior to the redemption date, funds sufficient to redeem
at the redemption price, all of the
redeemable Refunding Bonds for
which notice of redemption has been
given.
(c) Purchase in Lieu of Redemption. If and to the extent provided
in the Certificate of Award, the City
may elect to purchase Refunding
Bonds called for optional redemption in lieu of redeeming those
Refunding
Bonds.
That
election
shall be exercised by written direction from the Director of Finance to
the
Registrar
and
the
Escrow
Agent. That written direction shall
state whether all or less than all of
the Refunding Bonds called for
optional redemption are to be purchased by the City in lieu of
redemption,
shall
identify
the
Refunding Bonds to be purchased by
their maturity date and shall specify the principal amount of each
maturity to be purchased in lieu of
redemption. If less than all of the
Refunding Bonds called for optional
redemption are to be purchased in
lieu of redemption, the amount of
each maturity to be purchased shall
be in amounts of $5,000 or integral
multiples of $5,000. Any Refunding
Bonds called for optional redemption that are not to be purchased
shall be redeemed in accordance
with their redemption provisions.
The purchase price of the Refunding Bonds to be purchased in lieu of
redemption shall be equal to the
principal of, any accrued but unpaid
interest on, and any premium that
would have been payable on the
Refunding Bonds on the redemption
date if the Refunding Bonds had
been optionally redeemed instead of
being purchased. No notice of the
purchase in lieu of redemption is

595

9
required to be given to the owners
of the Refunding Bonds in addition
to the notice of redemption required
by this Ordinance. The Escrow
Agent or Registrar, as paying agent,
shall not purchase Refunding Bonds
if sufficient moneys have not been
deposited with the Escrow Agent or
Registrar, as paying agent, by the
City for the purpose. On or prior to
the scheduled date for optional
redemption, the City may rescind its
direction to purchase the Refunding
Bonds in lieu of redemption by written notice from the Director of
Finance to the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent. In the event that the
direction to purchase is rescinded,
the
Refunding
Bonds
shall
be
redeemed on the redemption date set
forth in the notice of redemption
delivered to the owners of the
Refunding Bonds and in accordance
with the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Partial Redemption or Purchase. If fewer than all of the outstanding
Refunding
Bonds
are
called for redemption at one time
(whether for redemption or purchase in lieu or redemption), they
shall be called in the order of maturities directed by the Director of
Finance. If fewer than all Refunding Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed or purchased in lieu
or
redemption,
the
selection
of
Refunding Bonds to be redeemed or
purchased, or portions thereof in
amounts of $5,000 or any integral
multiple thereof, shall be made by
the Registrar by lot in a manner
determined by the Registrar. In the
case of a partial redemption or purchase of Refunding Bonds by lot
when Refunding Bonds of denominations greater than $5,000 are then
outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as
though it were a separate Refunding Bond of the denomination of
$5,000. If it is determined that one
or more, but not all of the $5,000
units of principal amount represented by a Refunding Bond are to be
called for redemption, then upon
notice of redemption of a $5,000 unit
or units, the registered owner of
that Refunding Bond shall surrender the Refunding Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the redemption or purchase price of the $5,000
unit or units called for redemption
(including, without limitation, the
interest accrued to the date fixed
for redemption and any premium),
and
(ii)
for
issuance,
without
charge to the registered owner
thereof, of a new Refunding Bond
or Refunding Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the unmatured portion of the Bond not redeemed or
purchased, and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date as, the Refunding Bond
surrendered.
(e) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Refunding Bonds shall identify (i)
by designation, letters, numbers or
other
distinguishing
marks,
the
Refunding Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii) the redemption price to be paid, (iii) the date
fixed for redemption, and (iv) the
place or places where the amounts
due upon redemption are payable.
The notice shall be given by the
Registrar on behalf of the City by

10
mailing a copy of the redemption
notice by first class mail, postage
prepaid, at least thirty (30) days
prior to the date fixed for redemption (or such period specified in the
Certificate of Award), to the registered owner of each Refunding Bond
subject to redemption in whole or in
part
at
the
registered
owner’s
address shown on the Register (as
defined in Section 3) maintained by
the Registrar at the close of business on the fifteenth day preceding
that mailing and to any Credit Support Instrument (as defined in Section 12 hereof) for the Refunding
Bonds or designated portions thereof. Failure to receive notice by mail
or any defect in that notice regarding any Refunding Bond, however,
shall not affect the validity of the
proceedings for the redemption of
any Refunding Bond. Any notice of
redemption of any Refunding Bonds
may specify that the redemption is
contingent on the deposit of moneys
with the Escrow Agent or Registrar,
as paying agent, on or prior to the
redemption date in an amount sufficient to pay the redemption price
of the Refunding Bonds that are to
be redeemed.
(f) Payment of Redeemed Refunding
Bonds.
Notice
having
been
mailed in the manner provided in
the preceding paragraph, and moneys having been deposited by the
City with the Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying agent, in an
amount
sufficient
to
pay
the
redemption price, the Refunding
Bonds and portions thereof called
for redemption shall become due
and payable on the redemption date,
and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or places specified
in that notice, shall be paid. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Refunding Bonds and portions
thereof to be redeemed, including
interest accrued to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, and, if notice of
redemption has been deposited in
the mail, then from and after the
redemption date those Refunding
Bonds and portions thereof called
for redemption shall cease to bear
interest and no longer shall be considered to be outstanding. If that
money shall not be so available on
the redemption date, or that notice
shall not have been deposited in the
mail, those Refunding Bonds and
portions thereof shall continue to
bear interest, until they are paid, at
the same rate as they would have
borne had they not been called for
redemption. All money held by the
Registrar for the redemption of particular Refunding Bonds shall be
held in trust for the account of the
registered owners and shall be paid
to them, respectively, upon presentation
and
surrender
of
those
Refunding Bonds.
The debt charges on the Refunding Bonds shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of
America without deduction for the
services of the Registrar or Escrow
Agent as paying agent. Principal
shall be payable when due upon presentation
and
surrender
of
the
Refunding Bonds at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar. Interest on a Refunding Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Refunding Bond was registered, and

The City Record
to that person’s address appearing,
on the Register at the close of business on the date provided in the
Registrar Agreement authorized in
Section
3
(the
“Record
Date”).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance,
so long as the Refunding Bonds are
held by a Depository in a book entry
system (as described in Section 3),
debt charges on the Refunding
Bonds will be payable in lawful
money of the United States by wire
transfer to the Depository made by
the Escrow Agent on each Interest
Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance, except for the third paragraph of Section 13(a) (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 (pertaining generally to the periods during which the City is not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges
of
Refunding
Bonds
issued under the General Bond Ordinance), will apply to the Refunding
Bonds. Except for those provisions,
the General Bond Ordinance is
included as a part of this Ordinance
as fully as if restated in this Ordinance. Words and terms not otherwise defined in this Ordinance shall
have the same meaning as set forth
in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Refunding Bonds; Exchange and
Transfer of the Refunding Bonds;
Paying
Agents.
The
Refunding
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Refunding Bond shall
be authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee (as defined therein).
The
Refunding
Bonds
shall
be
signed by the City’s Mayor and by
the City’s Director of Finance, and,
consistent with Revised Code Section 133.27 and notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either or both of
those signatures may be a facsimile. The Refunding Bonds shall bear
the seal of the City, which seal may
be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s Charter, the
Director of Law shall prepare the
Refunding Bonds and shall endorse
thereon her approval of the form
thereof by her manual or facsimile
signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer
agent and paying agent for the
Refunding Bonds (the “Registrar”);
provided that the Escrow Agent
shall also act as paying agent for
the Refunding Bonds so long as the
Refunding Bonds are held in a book
entry
system.
The
Director
of
Finance is authorized to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, an agreement among the
City, the Registrar and the Escrow
Agent (the “Registrar Agreement”)
approved as to form by the Director
of Law, containing terms that are
not inconsistent with this Ordinance
and not substantially adverse to the
City and that are approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the

596

April 25, 2018
City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Registrar Agreement by the
Director of Finance. Payment for
the services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Registrar Agreement
shall be made from the proceeds of
the Refunding Bonds, to the extent
available,
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Refunding
Bonds remain outstanding, the City
will cause the Registrar to maintain
and keep at its principal corporate
trust office all books and records
necessary
for
the
registration,
exchange and transfer of Refunding
Bonds as provided in this Section
(the “Register”). Subject to the provisions of Section 4, the person in
whose name a Refunding Bond is
registered on the Register shall be
regarded as the absolute owner of
that Refunding Bond for all purposes of this Ordinance. Payment of or
on account of the debt charges on
any Refunding Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall be affected by any notice
to the contrary, but the registration
may be changed as provided in this
Section. All such payments shall be
valid and effectual to satisfy and
discharge the City’s liability upon
the Refunding Bond, including interest, to the extent of the amount or
amounts so paid.
Any Refunding Bond may be
exchanged for Refunding Bonds of
any authorized denomination upon
presentation and surrender at the
principal corporate trust office of
the
Registrar,
together
with
a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person
legally empowered to do so in a
form satisfactory to the Registrar. A
Refunding Bond may be transferred
only on the Register upon presentation and surrender of the Refunding
Bond at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar together with
an assignment signed by the registered owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Refunding Bond or
Refunding Bonds of any authorized
denomination
or
denominations
requested by the owner equal in the
aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Refunding Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Refunding Bonds only
after the new Refunding Bonds are
signed by the authorized officers of
the City. In all cases of Refunding
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall
authenticate
and
deliver
Refunding
Bonds
in
accordance
with the provisions of this Ordinance. The exchange or transfer
shall be without charge to the
owner, except that the City and Registrar may make a charge sufficient
to reimburse them for any tax or
other governmental charge required
to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or
the Registrar may require that those

April 25, 2018
charges, if any, be paid before the
procedure is begun for the exchange
or transfer. All Refunding Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
Ordinance, as the Refunding Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Refunding Bonds may be issued in
book entry form in accordance with
the provisions of this Section. As
used in this Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Refunding
Bonds and the principal of and
interest on the Refunding Bonds
may be transferred only through a
book
entry,
and
(ii)
physical
Refunding Bond certificates in fully
registered form are issued by the
City only to a Depository or its nominee as registered owner, with the
Refunding Bonds “immobilized” in
the custody of the Depository. The
book entry maintained by others
than the City is the record that identifies the owners of beneficial interests in those Refunding Bonds and
that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Refunding Bonds may be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as
long as a book entry system is utilized: (i) the Refunding Bonds may
be issued in the form of a single,
fully registered Refunding Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive
Refunding Bonds in the form of
physical securities or certificates;
(iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form shall be
shown by book entry on the system
maintained and operated by the
Depository and its Participants, and
transfers of the ownership of beneficial interests shall be made only
by book entry by the Depository and
its
Participants;
and
(iv)
the
Refunding Bonds as such shall not
be transferable or exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository

The City Record
for the Refunding Bonds for use in
a book entry system, the Director of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Refunding Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver Refunding Bond certificates
in registered form to the assigns of
the Depository or its nominee, all at
the cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Refunding Bonds, after determining
that the signing thereof will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and after the approval of
the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section
4.
Sale
of
Refunding
Bonds. The Refunding Bonds shall
first be offered for purchase to the
Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be
sold to one or more firms that have
proposed to underwrite the Refunding Bonds and have been selected
by the Director of Finance based on
an evaluation of the qualifications
of those firms (collectively, the
“Original Purchaser”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be
awarded to the Original Purchaser
in the Certificate of Award which
shall specify the final terms of the
Refunding
Bonds
in
accordance
with law, the provisions of this Ordinance, the written advice of a financial advisor retained under authority of Section 13 and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Refunding Bonds, including: the
principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds,
the
Tax
Status
of
the
Refunding
Bonds,
the
purchase
price (which shall be not less than
97% of the principal amount of the
Refunding Bonds plus any accrued
interest to their date of delivery),
interest rate or rates, the amounts
and years in which principal installments are payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements), the Interest Payment Dates
and the date of the Refunding
Bonds (if different from those set
forth in Section 2), and any other
matters required in this Ordinance
to be set forth in that Certificate. As
appropriate under the Charter, the
Mayor, Director of Finance, Director
of Law, Clerk of Council and other
appropriate officers of the City are,
and each of them is, authorized to
take such actions as are necessary,
appropriate and in the best interest
of the City to establish the terms
and requirements for delivery of the
Refunding Bonds and to make such
arrangements as are necessary with
the Original Purchaser in order to

597

11
establish the date, location, procedure, and conditions for the delivery
of the Refunding Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices and certificates, to cause
a true transcript of proceedings
with reference to the issuance of the
Refunding Bonds to be delivered to
the Original Purchaser, to sign any
transcript
certificates,
financial
statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Refunding Bonds. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City a bond purchase agreement
between the City and the Original
Purchaser
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
by the Director of Law, setting forth
the terms and conditions on which
the City agrees to sell the Refunding Bonds and the Original Purchaser agrees to buy the Refunding
Bonds, which shall be consistent
with this Ordinance, not substantially adverse to the City, and
approved by the Director of Finance
and the Director of Law on behalf
of the City, all of which shall be
conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Bond Purchase Agreement or amendments to the Bond
Purchase Agreement by the Director
of Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Refunding Bonds, as
provided in this Ordinance and as
may be provided in or pursuant to
the Certificate of Award, are in the
best interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an Official
Statement is appropriate or necessary in connection with the original
issuance of the Refunding Bonds,
the Director of Finance is authorized to prepare or cause to be prepared on behalf of the City an Official Statement and any necessary
supplements and to authorize the
use and distribution of that Official
Statement and any supplements. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign on behalf of the City that Official Statement and any supplements.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, on behalf
of the City, such certificates in connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements as may, in the Director’s
judgment, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is also
authorized to determine and certify
on behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final”
by the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
The Director of Finance is authorized to contract for services for the
production and distribution of preliminary and final official statements, including by printed and
electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Refunding Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as
the only obligated person with
respect to the Refunding Bonds
under the SEC Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial

12
information and operating data and
notices, in such manner, as may be
required for purposes of the SEC
Rule. In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared, and to sign
and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate,
which shall constitute the continuing disclosure agreement made by
the City for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of the
Refunding
Bonds
in
accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that Agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to

Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Refunding
Bonds promptly when and as the
same falls due, and also to provide
for the discharge of the Refunding
Bonds at maturity, there shall be
and is levied on all the taxable property in the City, in addition to all
other taxes, a direct tax annually
during the period the Refunding
Bonds
are
outstanding,
in
an
amount sufficient to provide for the
payment of that interest, when and
as the same shall fall due, and also
to discharge the principal of the
Refunding Bonds at maturity, which
tax shall not be less than the interest and sinking fund tax required
by Section 11 of Article XII of the
Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered
computed,
certified,
levied
and
extended upon the tax duplicate and
collected by the same officers, in the
same manner and at the same time
that taxes for general purposes for
each of those years are certified,
extended and collected. The tax
shall be placed before and in preference to all other items and for the
full amount thereof. The funds
derived from those tax levies shall
be placed in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the
General Bond Ordinance and those
funds, together with the interest collected on them shall be irrevocably
pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Refunding Bonds and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount
of such tax shall be reduced by the
amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Revised Code, and in accordance

The City Record
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Refunding Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds;
Notice of Redemption of Refunding
Bonds. Pursuant to Revised Code
Section 133.34, the General Bond
Ordinance and this Ordinance, the
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to
be applied to the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds shall be deposited
in a separate bank account within
the Unvoted Refunding Bond and
Note Redemption Account of the
Sinking Fund held by The Huntington National Bank, Cleveland,
Ohio, as Escrow Agent, in accordance with Section 179.08 of the Codified Ordinances of the City and the
Escrow Agreement described below,
and shall be applied to the payment
of debt service charges on the
Refunding Bonds from and after the
date of issuance of the Refunding
Bonds to and including their respective maturity or prior redemption
dates. The amount to be deposited
in the Escrow Fund shall be determined by the Director of Finance in
the Certificate of Award and shall
be the amount necessary, together
with money in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund available for the purpose, to provide for the refunding of
the Refunded Bonds. Any transfer to
the Escrow Fund of any money currently on deposit in the Unvoted
Tax Supported Obligations Account
and determined by the Director of
Finance to be available for payment
of the Refunding Bonds, is authorized by this Ordinance.
Money deposited in the Escrow
Fund shall be (a) held in cash or
(b) invested in direct obligations of
the United States of America that
mature or are subject to redemption
by and at the option of the holder,
in amounts sufficient, together with
any uninvested cash in the Escrow
Fund but without further investment or reinvestment, for the payment of the principal of, and any
redemption premium and interest on,
the Refunded Bonds as provided in
the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to
the respective Ordinances authorizing the Refunded Bonds, Section
133.34 of the Revised Code and this
Ordinance, money deposited in the
Escrow Fund, and the investment
income thereon, are pledged to the
payment of the Refunded Bonds.
Pursuant to Revised Code Chapter
133 and this Ordinance, and notwithstanding Chapter 179 of the Codified
Ordinances, any accrued interest
received
from
the
sale
of
the
Refunding Bonds and any original
issue premium in excess of the
amount deposited with the Escrow
Agent under the Escrow Agreement
to accomplish the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds shall be deposited
in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the Sinking Fund
to be applied to the payment of
interest on the Refunding Bonds.
The proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds to be applied to pay costs of
any
Credit
Support
Instruments
obtained pursuant to Section 12
shall be paid to the provider or
providers of those Credit Support
Instruments. The proceeds from the

598

April 25, 2018
sale of the Refunding Bonds to be
used to pay costs of issuing the
Refunding Bonds and refunding the
Refunded Bonds shall be deposited
with the Registrar in a separate
account under the Registrar Agreement pending their application to
the payment of such costs.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the Issuer,
an agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”) between the City and the
Escrow Agent, providing for the
investment and holding in escrow of
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds to be applied to the refunding of the Refunded Bonds and for
the
application
of
the
moneys
derived from such investments, in
accordance with the General Bond
Ordinance and this Ordinance and
as otherwise directed by law. Notice
of the advance refunding of any of
the Refunded Bonds and any direction for the redemption of Refunded
Bonds prior to stated maturity shall
be given in accordance with the
terms of the Refunded Bonds and as
further provided in the Escrow
Agreement. The Refunded Bonds
shall be retired at stated maturity
or redeemed prior to maturity as
provided in the Certificate of Award
and in accordance with the ordinance authorizing the respective
Refunded Bonds and the Escrow
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
from money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose. The Director of
Finance is authorized to obtain the
services of an independent accounting firm of national reputation to
provide a verification report as to
the adequacy of the escrow fund to
pay the Refunded Bonds on the
dates set forth in the Escrow Agreement. The Director of Finance and
other appropriate City officials shall
execute all documents and take all
other actions necessary or appropriate on the part of the City to effect
the
refunding
of
the
Refunded
Bonds in accordance with the General Bond Ordinance and this Ordinance and as otherwise directed by
law, and to cause the Refunded
Bonds to be deemed paid and discharged.
If U.S. Treasury Securities State
and Local Government Series are to
be purchased for the Escrow Fund,
the Escrow Agent is authorized to
file, on behalf of the City, subscriptions for the purchase and issuance
of those Securities. If those Securities are not timely available for purchase, or if in the judgment of the
Director of Finance, an open-market
purchase of direct obligations of the
United States of America for the
Escrow Fund is in the best interest
of and financially advantageous to
the City, the Director of Finance
may purchase and deliver those
obligations, engage the services of
a bidding agent or similar entity for
the purpose of facilitating the bidding, purchase and delivery of such
obligations for, and any related
structuring of, the Escrow Fund,
execute such instruments as are
deemed necessary to engage such
services for such purpose, and provide further for the payment of the
cost of obtaining such services from

April 25, 2018
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds to the extent available and
otherwise from any other funds lawfully available and that are appropriated or shall be appropriated for
that purpose.

specifically pledged pursuant to this
Ordinance and the General Bond
Ordinance and the other covenants,
terms
and
agreements
provided
hereunder and in the General Bond
Ordinance to secure payment of the
principal of and interest on the

and discharged all the outstanding
Refunding Bonds, or there shall otherwise be paid to the holders of the

made for paying all other sums
payable hereunder, then and in that
event this Ordinance (except for
Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to
be

without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds to their date of

of such payment; provided, that if
any Refunding Bonds are to be
redeemed prior to the maturity
thereof, notice of such redemption
shall have been duly given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the
Trustee shall have been duly made
for the giving of such notice. Any
moneys held by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the provisions of
this Section shall be invested by the
Escrow Agent in direct obligations
of the United States of America
maturing, or redeemable at the
option of the holder, at times and in
amounts sufficient to meet payment
of debt charges on the Refunding
Bonds, as directed by the Director
of Finance. Any income or interest

time to time by the Escrow Agent
to be in excess of the amount
required to be held by it for the purposes of this Section, be transferred

this Section shall be held and paid
as provided in said Section 17(a) for
unclaimed funds held by a Paying

Refunding Bonds authorized herein,
and nothing in this Ordinance shall

third paragraph of Section 4 of the
General Bond Ordinance pursuant to

and investment of, the proceeds of
the Tax-Exempt Refunding Bonds in
such manner and to such extent as

Tax-Exempt Refunding Bonds will
not (i) constitute private activity
bonds or arbitrage bonds under Sections 141 or 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
Code) or (ii) be treated other than

the Code applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of
the Code.

to
remain
excluded
from
gross

599

13
income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting
for it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of
the Tax-Exempt Refunding Bonds to
the governmental purpose of the
borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on
investment property acquired with
those proceeds, (iii) make timely
and adequate payments to the federal
government,
(iv)
maintain
books and records and make calculations and reports, and (v) refrain
from certain uses of those proceeds,
and,
as
applicable,
of
property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of
that interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Tax-Exempt
Refunding Bonds is also made with
respect to all issues any portion of
the debt service on which is paid
from proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Refunding Bonds (and, if different,

Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above are authorized
to take actions with respect to those
issues as they are authorized in this
section to take with respect to the
Tax-Exempt Refunding Bonds.

Referred to Directors of Finance,
Law; Committee on Finance.
Ord. No. 506-18.
By Council Member Kelley (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds
in the maximum principal amount of
$18,460,000 for the purpose of providing funds to improve municipal
parks and recreation facilities and
authorizing related matters.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $18,460,000
(the “Bonds”) to finance the costs of
certain
permanent
improvements
described in Section 1 of this ordinance (this “Ordinance”); and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has previously certified to this Council that
the estimated life or usefulness of
the improvements to be financed
with the proceeds of the Bonds is at
least five years and that the maximum maturity of the Bonds is 28
years, as evidenced by the certificate contained in File No. 506-18-A;
and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed May 6, 1983, and Ordinance
No. 944-96, passed June 10, 1996
(Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so amended and as the same may further be
amended from time to time in accordance with its provisions, is referred
to as the “General Bond Ordinance”),
providing the general terms and provisions for the issuance of unvoted
general obligations of the City, with
the specific terms of each series of
Bonds to be contained in ordinances
authorizing the issuance of bonds in
accordance
with
the
provisions
thereof (the “Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Bonds is necessary
to provide funds to pay the costs of
certain
permanent
improvements
described in Section 1 hereof that
are urgently needed for the benefit
of the City, and as a result, this
Ordinance constitutes an emergency
measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
property, health and safety, and for

Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant

the Constitution of Ohio, Chapter 133
of the Ohio Revised Code and other
applicable provisions of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Charter of the
City, the General Bond Ordinance
and this Ordinance for the purpose
stated in Section 1 hereof. The
Bonds shall be designated “Parks
and Recreation Facilities Improvement Bonds” and may contain such
further designation as provided in
the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Bonds and
the sale of the Bonds signed by the
Director of Finance in accordance
with this Ordinance (the “Certificate
of Award”). The Bonds shall be
issued in one lot as fully registered

The Bonds shall be issued in the
principal amount specified in the
Certificate of Award, which shall
not exceed the amount stated in Section 1 hereof. The Bonds shall be
dated their date of issuance and
shall bear interest from their date
until the principal amount is paid at
the rate or rates per year specified
in the Certificate of Award, provided that the weighted average of
such rates (taking into account the
principal amount and maturity of
each Bond to which a rate applies)
shall not exceed 6.00% per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable when due, or until the principal amount is paid, semiannually
on June 1 and December 1 of each
year that the Bonds are outstanding,
commencing December 1, 2018 (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), unless
otherwise determined by the Director of Finance in the Certificate of
Award.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as
shall be permitted by law and determined by the Director of Finance
and specified in the Certificate of
Award, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor (as defined in

The City Record
Section 16) to be in the best interests of the City, provided that (i)
each principal payment shall occur
on an Interest Payment Date, (ii)
the first principal payment on the
Bonds shall be no later than August
1, 2020, (iii) the final maturity date
of the Bonds shall be no later than
28 years from that date which is 12
months prior to the first date on
which provision for payment of principal is made, and (iv) the principal
amount thereof shall be payable in
annual installments such that the
total principal and interest payments on the Bonds in any fiscal
year in which principal is payable
is not more than three times the
amount of those payments in any
other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption or purchase prior to stated maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of
100%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds
shall include amounts sufficient to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3 hereof) for cancellation
Term Bonds in any aggregate principal amount and to receive a credit against the then-current Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory redemption obligation)
of the City for any Term Bonds.
That option shall be exercised by
the City on or before the forty-fifth
day preceding the applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, by furnishing
the Escrow Agent a certificate,
signed by the Registrar, setting
forth the extent of the credit to be
applied with respect to the then-current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is not timely furnished to
the Escrow Agent, the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory

601

15
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds that
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and cancelled by the Registrar, to the
extent not applied theretofore as a
credit
against
any
mandatory
redemption obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and cancelled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100% of the
principal amount thereof against the
then-current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then-current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole or in
part on any date, in integral multiples of $5,000, on the optional
redemption dates and at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date shall not be later than ten
years from the first Interest Payment Date, and the highest redemption price shall not be greater than
102%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed plus accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor, the Director of Finance may
determine
in
the
Certificate
of
Award that it is in the best interests of the City for some or all of
the Bonds not to be callable prior to
their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar. That notice shall specify
the redemption date and the principal amount of each maturity of
Bonds to be redeemed, and shall be
given at least 45 days prior to the
redemption date or such shorter
period as shall be acceptable to the
Registrar. There shall be deposited
with the Registrar on or prior to the
redemption date funds sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price all
of the redeemable Bonds for which
notice of redemption has been given.
(c) Purchase in Lieu of Redemption. If and to the extent provided
in the Certificate of Award, the City

16
may elect to purchase Bonds called
for optional redemption in lieu of
redeeming those Bonds. That election shall be exercised by written
direction
from
the
Director
of
Finance to the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent. That written direction shall state whether all or less
than all of the Bonds called for
optional redemption are to be purchased by the City in lieu of
redemption, shall identify the Bonds
to be purchased by their maturity
date and shall specify the principal
amount of each maturity to be purchased in lieu of redemption. If less
than all of the Bonds called for
optional redemption are to be purchased in lieu of redemption, the
amount of each maturity to be purchased shall be in amounts of $5,000
or integral multiples of $5,000. Any
Bonds called for optional redemption that are not to be purchased
shall be redeemed in accordance
with their redemption provisions.
The purchase price of the Bonds to
be purchased in lieu of redemption
shall be equal to the principal of,
any accrued but unpaid interest on,
and any premium that would have
been payable on the Bonds on the
redemption date if the Bonds had
been optionally redeemed instead of
being purchased. No notice of the
purchase in lieu of redemption is
required to be given to the owners
of the Bonds in addition to the
notice of redemption required by
this Ordinance. The Escrow Agent
or Registrar, as paying agent, shall
not purchase Bonds if sufficient
moneys have not been deposited
with the Escrow Agent or Registrar,
as paying agent, by the City for the
purpose. On or prior to the scheduled date for optional redemption,
the City may rescind its direction to
purchase the Bonds in lieu of
redemption by written notice from
the Director of Finance to the Registrar and the Escrow Agent. In the
event that the direction to purchase
is rescinded, the Bonds shall be
redeemed on the redemption date set
forth in the notice of redemption
delivered to the owners of the Bonds
and in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Partial Redemption or Purchase. If fewer than all of the outstanding
Bonds
are
called
for
redemption at one time (whether for
redemption or purchase in lieu of
redemption), they shall be called in
the order of maturities directed by
the Director of Finance. If fewer
than all Bonds of a single maturity
are to be redeemed or purchased in
lieu of redemption, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed or purchased,
or portions thereof in amounts of
$5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, shall be made by the Registrar
by lot in a manner determined by
the Registrar. In the case of a partial
redemption
or
purchase
of
Bonds by lot when Bonds of denominations greater than $5,000 are then
outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as
though it were a separate Bond of
the denomination of $5,000. If it is
determined that one or more, but not
all of the $5,000 units of principal
amount represented by a Bond are
to be called for redemption, then
upon notice of redemption of a
$5,000 unit or units, the registered
owner of that Bond shall surrender
the Bond to the Registrar (i) for

The City Record
payment of the redemption or purchase price of the $5,000 unit or
units called for redemption (including, without limitation, the interest
accrued
to
the
date
fixed
for
redemption and any premium), and
(ii) for issuance, without charge to
the registered owner thereof, of a
new Bond or Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the unmatured portion of the Bond not redeemed or
purchased and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date as the Bond surrendered.
(e) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption
notice
by
first-class
mail, postage prepaid, at least 30
days prior to the date fixed for
redemption (or such period specified
in the Certificate of Award), to the
registered owner of each Bond subject to redemption in whole or in
part
at
the
registered
owner’s
address shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at
the close of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing
and to any provider of a Credit Support Instrument (as defined in Section 15 hereof) for the Bonds or designated portions thereof. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond. Any notice
of redemption of any Bonds may
specify that the redemption is contingent on the deposit of moneys
with the Escrow Agent or Registrar,
as paying agent, on or prior to the
redemption date in an amount sufficient to pay the redemption price
of the Bonds to be redeemed.
(f) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph, and moneys having been
deposited by the City with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying agent, in an amount sufficient
to pay the redemption price, the
Bonds and portions thereof called
for redemption shall become due
and payable on the redemption date,
and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or places specified
in that notice, shall be paid. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, including interest accrued
to the redemption date, is held by
the Registrar on the redemption
date, and, if notice of redemption
has been deposited in the mail, then
from and after the redemption date
those Bonds and portions thereof
called for redemption shall cease to
bear interest and no longer shall be
considered to be outstanding. If that
money shall not be so available on
the redemption date, or that notice
shall not have been deposited in the
mail, those Bonds and portions
thereof shall continue to bear interest, until they are paid, at the same
rate as they would have borne had

602

April 25, 2018
they not been called for redemption.
All money held by the Registrar for
the redemption of particular Bonds
shall be held in trust for the account
of the registered owners and shall
be paid to them, respectively, upon
presentation and surrender of those
Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3 hereof) at the close of business on
the date provided in the Registrar
Agreement authorized and defined
in Section 3 hereof (the “Record
Date”). Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond
Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are
held by a Depository in a book-entry
system (as described in Section 3
hereof), debt charges on the Bonds
will be payable in lawful money of
the United States by wire transfer
to the Depository made by the
Escrow Agent on each Interest Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance, except for the third paragraph of Section 13(a) (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 (pertaining generally to the periods during which the City is not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), will apply
to the Bonds. Except for those provisions, the General Bond Ordinance
is included as a part of this Ordinance as fully as if restated in this
Ordinance. Words and terms not otherwise defined in this Ordinance
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee (as
defined therein). The Bonds shall be
signed by the City’s Mayor and by
the City’s Director of Finance, and,
consistent with Section 133.27 of the
Ohio Revised Code and notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either
or both of those signatures may be
a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear
the seal of the City, which seal may
be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s Charter, the
Director of Law shall prepare the
Bonds and shall endorse thereon the
Director of Law’s approval of the
form thereof by the Director of
Law’s manual or facsimile signature.

April 25, 2018
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer
agent and paying agent for the
Bonds
(the
“Registrar”).
The
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book-entry
system. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
an agreement among the City, Registrar and Escrow Agent (the “Registrar Agreement”), approved as to
form by the Director of Law, providing for services relating to the
registration, transfer, exchange and
payment of the Bonds on terms
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City and consistent
with this Ordinance and not substantially adverse to the City. That
approval shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Registrar Agreement by the Director of
Finance. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Registrar Agreement
from the proceeds of the Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the “Bond Register”). The person in whose name a
Bond is registered on the Bond Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Bond for all
purposes of this Ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Bond shall be made only to
or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar

The City Record
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
Ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book-entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book-entry form” or “book-entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book-entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds,
in
book-entry
form,
and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book-entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book-entry
system and, if and as long as a
book-entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book-entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book-entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of

603

17
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a bookentry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book-entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized to the extent necessary or required to enter into any
agreements determined necessary in
connection with the book-entry system for the Bonds, after determining that the signing thereof will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and after the approval of
the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by them,
shall be offered to the Treasury
Investment Account for purchase
and, if not purchased for that
Account, shall be sold to one or
more firms that have proposed to
underwrite or purchase the Bonds
and have been selected by the Director of Finance based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those
firms (collectively, the “Original
Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance, the written advice
of a financial advisor retained under
authority of Section 16 hereof and
the Original Purchaser’s offer to
purchase the Bonds, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, the
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount of the Bonds plus any
accrued interest to their date of
delivery), interest rate or rates, the
amounts and years in which principal installments are payable (at
stated
maturity
or
pursuant
to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements), the Interest
Payment Dates and the date of the
Bonds
and
any
other
matters
required in this Ordinance to be set
forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the Charter, the Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of
Law, Clerk of Council and other
appropriate officers of the City are,
and each of them is, authorized to
take such actions as are necessary,
appropriate and in the best interest
of the City to establish the terms

18
and requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original Purchaser in order to establish the date, location, procedures,
and conditions for the delivery of
the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices
and certificates, to cause a true
transcript of proceedings with reference to the issuance of the Bonds
to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and
other documents and instruments
and to take such actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Ordinance and to take all
steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Bonds. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City a bond purchase agreement
between the City and the Original
Purchaser
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
by the Director of Law, setting forth
the terms and conditions on which
the City agrees to sell the Bonds
and the Original Purchaser agrees
to buy the Bonds, which shall be
consistent with this Ordinance, not
substantially adverse to the City,
and approved by the Director of
Finance on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Bond
Purchase Agreement by the Director
of Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Bonds, as provided in
this Ordinance and as may be provided in or pursuant to the Certificate of Award, are in the best interest of the City and in compliance
with all legal requirements.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Director
of Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 2018”
or such other designation as may be
set forth in the Certificate of Award.
Such bonds shall contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the
Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes, a direct
tax annually during the period the
Bonds
are
outstanding,
in
an
amount sufficient to provide for the
payment of that interest, when and
as the same shall fall due, and also
to discharge the principal of the
Bonds at maturity, which tax shall
not be less than the interest and
sinking fund tax required by Section
11 of Article XII of the Constitution
of Ohio.
The tax shall be within the tenmill limitation imposed by law, shall
be and is ordered computed, certified, levied and extended upon the
tax duplicate and collected by the
same officers, in the same manner
and at the same time that taxes for

The City Record
general purposes for each of those
years are certified, extended and
collected, and shall be placed before
and in preference to all other items
and for the full amount thereof. The
funds derived from those tax levies
shall be placed in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account of
the Sinking Fund as required by the
General Bond Ordinance, and those
funds, together with the interest collected on them, shall be irrevocably
pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds
when and as the same fall due; provided, however, that, subject to the
provisions of Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in each year to
the extent that revenues are available from other sources for the payment of the Bonds and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount
of such tax shall be reduced by the
amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Ohio Revised Code, and in accordance with the provisions of and to
the extent required or permitted by
the General Bond Ordinance, that
the City will appropriate annually
from the proceeds of the City’s
municipal income taxes an amount
as is necessary to meet the annual
debt charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds
are issued. The proceeds of the
Bonds to be applied to pay costs of
any
Credit
Support
Instruments
obtained pursuant to Section 15 hereof shall be paid to the provider or
providers of those Credit Support
Instruments. The proceeds from the
sale of the Bonds to be used to pay
costs of issuing the Bonds shall be
deposited with the Registrar in a
separate account under the Registrar Agreement pending their application to the payment of such costs.
Pursuant to Chapter 133 of the Ohio
Revised Code and this Ordinance,
and notwithstanding Chapter 179 of
the
Codified
Ordinances,
any
accrued interest and any premium
received from the sale of the Bonds
shall be deposited in the Unvoted
Tax Supported Obligations Account
of the Sinking Fund to be applied
to the payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and
agreements provided hereunder and
in the General Bond Ordinance to
secure payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds, the City
hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that the Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit
and general property taxing power
(as described in Section 5) of the
City are hereby pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds in accordance with

604

April 25, 2018
the laws and Constitution of the
State of Ohio, this Ordinance and the
General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or subaccounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or subaccounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by an
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest,
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance

April 25, 2018
for unclaimed funds held by a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment of any Bond as described
in Section 17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section
17(a) for unclaimed funds held by a
Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purpose set forth in
Section 1 hereof, notes of the City
may be issued in an aggregate principal
amount
not
to
exceed
$18,460,000 (the “Notes”) upon the
direction of the Director of Finance
to be set forth in a certificate providing for the final terms of the
Notes and the sale of the Notes and
signed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
(a) Terms of the Notes. The Notes

set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award, which shall be no later than
five
years
from
such
date
of
issuance; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, provided that, if the Director of Finance,
based on the advice of a financial
advisor, determines that it is in the
best interest of the City in order to
enhance the marketability of the
Notes, the Director of Finance may
cause
the
Notes
to
not
be
redeemable for a period which ends
no later than the date which is two
years following the date of issuance
of the Notes; shall be designated
“Parks and Recreation Facilities
Improvement
Bond
Anticipation
Notes”; shall be issued in such numbers and denominations as may be
requested by the Note Purchaser
(hereinafter defined); and shall be
issued in fully registered form
(which may be in a book-entry only
system) in denominations of $5,000
or integral multiples thereof. Interest shall be payable semiannually
on the dates set forth in the Note
Certificate of Award; provided that
if the Notes mature on or before the
end of the twelfth month following
their date of issuance, interest on
the Notes shall be payable at maturity.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Notes (the
“Note
Registrar”).
The
Escrow
Agent also shall act as paying
agent for the Notes if the Notes are
held in a book-entry system. The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, an agreement among the
City, the Note Registrar and the
Escrow Agent (the “Note Registrar
Agreement”) providing for services
relating to the registration, transfer,
exchange and payment of Notes on
terms that are approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City. That approval shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Note Registrar Agreement by
the Director of Finance. The Director of Finance shall provide for the
payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Note Registrar Agreement from the proceeds

The City Record
of the Notes to the extent available
and then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to
be appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Note Registrar to maintain and keep at its principal corporate trust office all books and
records necessary for the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes
as provided in this Section (the
“Note Register”). The person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Note
for all purposes of this Ordinance.
Payment of or on account of the
debt charges on any Note shall be
made only to or upon the order of
that person; neither the City nor the
Note Registrar shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary, but the
registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Note Registrar, together with a request for exchange
signed by the registered owner or
by a person legally empowered to do
so in a form satisfactory to the Note
Registrar. A Note may be transferred only on the Note Register
upon presentation and surrender of
the Note at the principal corporate
trust office of the Note Registrar
together with an assignment signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer
the Note Registrar shall complete,
authenticate and deliver a new Note
or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested
by the owner equal in the aggregate
to the unmatured principal amount
of the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange
or transfer of Notes only after the
new Notes are signed by the authorized officers of the City. In all
cases of Notes exchanged or transferred, the City shall sign and the
Note Registrar shall authenticate
and deliver Notes in accordance
with the provisions of this Ordinance. The exchange or transfer
shall be without charge to the
owner, except that the City and Note
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Note Registrar may require
that those charges, if any, be paid
before the procedure is begun for
the exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
Ordinance, as the Notes surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Director
of Finance may combine the Notes

605

19
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City for purposes of their sale
as a single issue to be designated
“Various Purpose General Obligation
Bond Anticipation Notes.” The Notes
shall contain a summary statement
of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the Notes are issued
and shall state that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance.
(b) Execution and Payment of the
Notes. The Notes shall express upon
their faces the purpose for which
they are issued and that they are
issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Each Note shall be authenticated by
the manual signature of an authorized officer of the Trustee (as
defined therein). The Notes shall be
signed by the City’s Mayor and by
the City’s Director of Finance, and,
consistent with Section 133.27 of the
Ohio Revised Code and notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either
or both of those signatures may be
a facsimile. The Notes shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law shall prepare the Notes
and shall endorse thereon the Director of Law’s approval of the form
thereof by the Director of Law’s
manual or facsimile signature.
(c) Sale of the Notes. The Notes
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund
and, if not purchased by them, shall
be offered to the Treasury Investment Account for purchase and, if
not purchased for that Account,
shall be sold to one or more firms
that have proposed to underwrite or
purchase the Notes and have been
selected by the Director of Finance
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those firms (the “Note
Purchaser”) in the principal amount
set forth in a certificate of award to
be executed by the Director of
Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section
10 hereof. The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund
and used for the purpose for which
the Notes are being issued under the
provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Security for the Notes. The
Notes shall be secured by a pledge
and lien on a parity with the
pledges and liens authorized by the
General Bond Ordinance and, in
addition to the taxes and revenues
specifically pledged pursuant to this
Ordinance and the General Bond
Ordinance and the other covenants,
terms
and
agreements
provided
hereunder and in the General Bond
Ordinance to secure payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Notes, the City hereby determines,
declares, warrants and covenants
that the Notes are general obligations of the City and that the full
faith and credit and general property taxing power (as described in
Section 5) of the City are hereby
pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Notes in
accordance with the laws and Constitution of the State of Ohio, this
Ordinance and the General Bond
Ordinance. The par value to be
received from the sale of the Bonds
or of any renewal notes and any
excess funds resulting from the
issuance of the Notes shall, to the
extent necessary, be used to pay the

20
debt charges on the Notes at maturity and are pledged for that purpose.
Section 10. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes. That tax shall be
and is ordered computed, certified,
levied and extended upon the tax
duplicate and collected by the same
officers, in the same manner and at
the same time that taxes for general purposes for each year are certified, extended and collected. That
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies required
by this Ordinance shall be placed in
the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account, and those funds,
together with the interest collected
on
them,
shall
be
irrevocably
pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of the Notes or the
Bonds in anticipation of which they
are issued, when and as the same
falls due; provided, however, that in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the Notes
and Bonds and are appropriated for
such purpose, the amount of such
direct tax upon all of the taxable
property in the City may be reduced
by the amount of such revenues so
available and appropriated.
Section 11. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a
disclosure document (each, an “Official Statement”) is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
sale of the Notes or the Bonds, the
Director of Finance is authorized to
prepare or cause to be prepared on
behalf of the City an Official Statement with respect to the Notes or
the Bonds, as the case may be, and
any necessary supplements and to
authorize the use and distribution of
each Official Statement and any supplements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
each Official Statement and any supplements approved by her. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of each Official Statement and any supplements as may,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is also
authorized to determine and certify
on behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final”
by the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
The Director of Finance is authorized to contract for services for the
production and distribution of preliminary and final Official Statements, including by printed and
electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes or the Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as
the only obligated person with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds

The City Record
under the SEC Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information and operating data and
notices, in such manner as may be
required for purposes of the SEC

that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and to sign
and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate,
which shall constitute the continuing disclosure agreement made by
the City for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of the

be, in accordance with the SEC
Rule.
The
performance
of
that
agreement shall be subject to the
availability of funds and their annual appropriation to meet costs the
City would be required to incur to
perform it. The Director of Finance
is further authorized to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices.

of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield
on
investment

Director of Finance may obtain an
insurance policy, letter of credit,
standby bond purchase agreement
or other credit enhancement instrument as further security for the payment when due of the principal of
and interest on all or any portion of
the Bonds or any Notes (a “Credit

Ord. No. 507-18.
By Council Member Kelley (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds
in the maximum principal amount of

structures housing and providing for
the discharge of governmental functions and services otherwise benefiting the public safety, health and
welfare and for the provision of necessary fixtures, furnishings, equipment,
technology,
appurtenances,
utilities, and site improvements for

(the “Bonds”) to finance the costs of

607

21
certain
permanent
improvements
described in Section 1 of this ordinance (this “Ordinance”); and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has previously certified to this Council that
the estimated life or usefulness of
the improvements to be financed
with the proceeds of the Bonds is at
least five years and that the maximum maturity of the Bonds is 13
years, as evidenced by the certificate contained in File No. 507-18-A;

and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed May 6, 1983, and Ordinance
No. 944-96, passed June 10, 1996
(Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so amended and as the same may further be
amended from time to time in accordance with its provisions, is referred
to as the “General Bond Ordinance”),
providing the general terms and provisions for the issuance of unvoted
general obligations of the City, with
the specific terms of each series of
Bonds to be contained in ordinances
authorizing the issuance of bonds in
accordance
with
the
provisions
thereof (the “Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Bonds is necessary
to provide funds to pay the costs of
certain
permanent
improvements
described in Section 1 hereof that
are urgently needed for the benefit
of the City, and as a result, this
Ordinance constitutes an emergency
measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
property, health and safety, and for
the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

aggregate principal amount not to
exceed $6,085,000 for the purpose of
providing funds for constructing,

and such other costs of the foregoing permanent improvements that

and as otherwise permitted by law.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant

22
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Chapter 133
of the Ohio Revised Code and other
applicable provisions of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Charter of the
City, the General Bond Ordinance
and this Ordinance for the purpose
stated in Section 1 hereof. The
Bonds shall be designated “Public
Facilities Improvement Bonds” and
may contain such further designation as provided in the certificate of
award providing for the final terms
of the Bonds and the sale of the
Bonds signed by the Director of
Finance in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Bonds shall be issued
in one lot as fully registered Bonds
in denominations of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof. The Bonds
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be issued in the
principal amount specified in the
Certificate of Award, which shall
not exceed the amount stated in Section 1 hereof. The Bonds shall be
dated their date of issuance and
shall bear interest from their date
until the principal amount is paid at
the rate or rates per year specified
in the Certificate of Award, provided that the weighted average of
such rates (taking into account the
principal amount and maturity of
each Bond to which a rate applies)
shall not exceed 6.00% per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable when due, or until the principal amount is paid, semiannually
on June 1 and December 1 of each
year that the Bonds are outstanding,
commencing December 1, 2018 (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), unless
otherwise determined by the Director of Finance in the Certificate of
Award.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as
shall be permitted by law and determined by the Director of Finance
and specified in the Certificate of
Award, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor (as defined in
Section 16) to be in the best interests of the City, provided that (i)
each principal payment shall occur
on an Interest Payment Date, (ii)
the first principal payment on the
Bonds shall be no later than August
1, 2020, (iii) the final maturity date
of the Bonds shall be no later than
13 years from that date which is 12
months prior to the first date on
which provision for payment of principal is made, and (iv) the principal
amount thereof shall be payable in
annual installments such that the
total principal and interest payments on the Bonds in any fiscal
year in which principal is payable
is not more than three times the
amount of those payments in any
other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the

The City Record
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption or purchase prior to stated maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of
100%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds
shall include amounts sufficient to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3 hereof) for cancellation
Term Bonds in any aggregate principal amount and to receive a credit against the then-current Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory redemption obligation)
of the City for any Term Bonds.
That option shall be exercised by
the City on or before the forty-fifth
day preceding the applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, by furnishing
the Escrow Agent a certificate,
signed by the Registrar, setting
forth the extent of the credit to be
applied with respect to the then-current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is not timely furnished to
the Escrow Agent, the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds that
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and cancelled by the Registrar, to the
extent not applied theretofore as a
credit
against
any
mandatory
redemption obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and cancelled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100% of the
principal amount thereof against the
then-current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then-current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption

608

April 25, 2018
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole or in
part on any date, in integral multiples of $5,000, on the optional
redemption dates and at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date shall not be later than ten
years from the first Interest Payment Date, and the highest redemption price shall not be greater than
102%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed plus accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor, the Director of Finance may
determine
in
the
Certificate
of
Award that it is in the best interests of the City for some or all of
the Bonds not to be callable prior to
their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar. That notice shall specify
the redemption date and the principal amount of each maturity of
Bonds to be redeemed, and shall be
given at least 45 days prior to the
redemption date or such shorter
period as shall be acceptable to the
Registrar. There shall be deposited
with the Registrar on or prior to the
redemption date funds sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price all
of the redeemable Bonds for which
notice of redemption has been given.
(c) Purchase in Lieu of Redemption. If and to the extent provided
in the Certificate of Award, the City
may elect to purchase Bonds called
for optional redemption in lieu of
redeeming those Bonds. That election shall be exercised by written
direction
from
the
Director
of
Finance to the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent. That written direction shall state whether all or less
than all of the Bonds called for
optional redemption are to be purchased by the City in lieu of
redemption, shall identify the Bonds
to be purchased by their maturity
date and shall specify the principal
amount of each maturity to be purchased in lieu of redemption. If less
than all of the Bonds called for
optional redemption are to be purchased in lieu of redemption, the
amount of each maturity to be purchased shall be in amounts of $5,000
or integral multiples of $5,000. Any
Bonds called for optional redemption that are not to be purchased
shall be redeemed in accordance
with their redemption provisions.
The purchase price of the Bonds to
be purchased in lieu of redemption
shall be equal to the principal of,
any accrued but unpaid interest on,
and any premium that would have
been payable on the Bonds on the
redemption date if the Bonds had
been optionally redeemed instead of
being purchased. No notice of the

April 25, 2018
purchase in lieu of redemption is
required to be given to the owners
of the Bonds in addition to the
notice of redemption required by
this Ordinance. The Escrow Agent
or Registrar, as paying agent, shall
not purchase Bonds if sufficient
moneys have not been deposited
with the Escrow Agent or Registrar,
as paying agent, by the City for the
purpose. On or prior to the scheduled date for optional redemption,
the City may rescind its direction to
purchase the Bonds in lieu of
redemption by written notice from
the Director of Finance to the Registrar and the Escrow Agent. In the
event that the direction to purchase
is rescinded, the Bonds shall be
redeemed on the redemption date set
forth in the notice of redemption
delivered to the owners of the Bonds
and in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Partial Redemption or Purchase. If fewer than all of the outstanding
Bonds
are
called
for
redemption at one time (whether for
redemption or purchase in lieu of
redemption), they shall be called in
the order of maturities directed by
the Director of Finance. If fewer
than all Bonds of a single maturity
are to be redeemed or purchased in
lieu of redemption, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed or purchased,
or portions thereof in amounts of
$5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, shall be made by the Registrar
by lot in a manner determined by
the Registrar. In the case of a partial
redemption
or
purchase
of
Bonds by lot when Bonds of denominations greater than $5,000 are then
outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as
though it were a separate Bond of
the denomination of $5,000. If it is
determined that one or more, but not
all of the $5,000 units of principal
amount represented by a Bond are
to be called for redemption, then
upon notice of redemption of a
$5,000 unit or units, the registered
owner of that Bond shall surrender
the Bond to the Registrar (i) for
payment of the redemption or purchase price of the $5,000 unit or
units called for redemption (including, without limitation, the interest
accrued
to
the
date
fixed
for
redemption and any premium), and
(ii) for issuance, without charge to
the registered owner thereof, of a
new Bond or Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the unmatured portion of the Bond not redeemed or
purchased and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date as the Bond surrendered.
(e) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption
notice
by
first-class
mail, postage prepaid, at least 30
days prior to the date fixed for
redemption (or such period specified
in the Certificate of Award), to the
registered owner of each Bond subject to redemption in whole or in

The City Record
part
at
the
registered
owner’s
address shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at
the close of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing
and to any provider of a Credit Support Instrument (as defined in Section 15 hereof) for the Bonds or designated portions thereof. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond. Any notice
of redemption of any Bonds may
specify that the redemption is contingent on the deposit of moneys
with the Escrow Agent or Registrar,
as paying agent, on or prior to the
redemption date in an amount sufficient to pay the redemption price
of the Bonds to be redeemed.
(f) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph, and moneys having been
deposited by the City with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying agent, in an amount sufficient
to pay the redemption price, the
Bonds and portions thereof called
for redemption shall become due
and payable on the redemption date,
and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or places specified
in that notice, shall be paid. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, including interest accrued
to the redemption date, is held by
the Registrar on the redemption
date, and, if notice of redemption
has been deposited in the mail, then
from and after the redemption date
those Bonds and portions thereof
called for redemption shall cease to
bear interest and no longer shall be
considered to be outstanding. If that
money shall not be so available on
the redemption date, or that notice
shall not have been deposited in the
mail, those Bonds and portions
thereof shall continue to bear interest, until they are paid, at the same
rate as they would have borne had
they not been called for redemption.
All money held by the Registrar for
the redemption of particular Bonds
shall be held in trust for the account
of the registered owners and shall
be paid to them, respectively, upon
presentation and surrender of those
Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3 hereof) at the close of business on
the date provided in the Registrar
Agreement authorized and defined
in Section 3 hereof (the “Record
Date”). Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond
Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are
held by a Depository in a book-entry
system (as described in Section 3
hereof), debt charges on the Bonds
will be payable in lawful money of

609

23
the United States by wire transfer
to the Depository made by the
Escrow Agent on each Interest Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance, except for the third paragraph of Section 13(a) (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 (pertaining generally to the periods during which the City is not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), will apply
to the Bonds. Except for those provisions, the General Bond Ordinance
is included as a part of this Ordinance as fully as if restated in this
Ordinance. Words and terms not otherwise defined in this Ordinance
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee (as
defined therein). The Bonds shall be
signed by the City’s Mayor and by
the City’s Director of Finance, and,
consistent with Section 133.27 of the
Ohio Revised Code and notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either
or both of those signatures may be
a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear
the seal of the City, which seal may
be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s Charter, the
Director of Law shall prepare the
Bonds and shall endorse thereon the
Director of Law’s approval of the
form thereof by the Director of
Law’s manual or facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer
agent and paying agent for the
Bonds
(the
“Registrar”).
The
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book-entry
system. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
an agreement among the City, Registrar and Escrow Agent (the “Registrar Agreement”), approved as to
form by the Director of Law, providing for services relating to the
registration, transfer, exchange and
payment of the Bonds on terms
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City and consistent
with this Ordinance and not substantially adverse to the City. That
approval shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Registrar Agreement by the Director of
Finance. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Registrar Agreement
from the proceeds of the Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.

24
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the “Bond Register”). The person in whose name a
Bond is registered on the Bond Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Bond for all
purposes of this Ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Bond shall be made only to
or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
Ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book-entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:

The City Record
“Book-entry form” or “book-entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book-entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds,
in
book-entry
form,
and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book-entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book-entry
system and, if and as long as a
book-entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book-entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book-entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a bookentry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book-entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized to the extent necessary or required to enter into any

610

April 25, 2018
agreements determined necessary in
connection with the book-entry system for the Bonds, after determining that the signing thereof will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and after the approval of
the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by them,
shall be offered to the Treasury
Investment Account for purchase
and, if not purchased for that
Account, shall be sold to one or
more firms that have proposed to
underwrite or purchase the Bonds
and have been selected by the Director of Finance based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those
firms (collectively, the “Original
Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance, the written advice
of a financial advisor retained under
authority of Section 16 hereof and
the Original Purchaser’s offer to
purchase the Bonds, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, the
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount of the Bonds plus any
accrued interest to their date of
delivery), interest rate or rates, the
amounts and years in which principal installments are payable (at
stated
maturity
or
pursuant
to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements), the Interest
Payment Dates and the date of the
Bonds
and
any
other
matters
required in this Ordinance to be set
forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the Charter, the Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of
Law, Clerk of Council and other
appropriate officers of the City are,
and each of them is, authorized to
take such actions as are necessary,
appropriate and in the best interest
of the City to establish the terms
and requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original Purchaser in order to establish the date, location, procedures,
and conditions for the delivery of
the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices
and certificates, to cause a true
transcript of proceedings with reference to the issuance of the Bonds
to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and
other documents and instruments
and to take such actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Ordinance and to take all
steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Bonds. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City a bond purchase agreement
between the City and the Original
Purchaser
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
by the Director of Law, setting forth
the terms and conditions on which
the City agrees to sell the Bonds
and the Original Purchaser agrees
to buy the Bonds, which shall be
consistent with this Ordinance, not
substantially adverse to the City,

April 25, 2018
and approved by the Director of
Finance on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Bond
Purchase Agreement by the Director
of Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Bonds, as provided in
this Ordinance and as may be provided in or pursuant to the Certificate of Award, are in the best interest of the City and in compliance
with all legal requirements.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Director
of Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 2018”
or such other designation as may be
set forth in the Certificate of Award.
Such bonds shall contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the
Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes, a direct
tax annually during the period the
Bonds
are
outstanding,
in
an
amount sufficient to provide for the
payment of that interest, when and
as the same shall fall due, and also
to discharge the principal of the
Bonds at maturity, which tax shall
not be less than the interest and
sinking fund tax required by Section
11 of Article XII of the Constitution
of Ohio.
The tax shall be within the ten
mill limitation imposed by law, shall
be and is ordered computed, certified, levied and extended upon the
tax duplicate and collected by the
same officers, in the same manner
and at the same time that taxes for
general purposes for each of those
years are certified, extended and
collected, and shall be placed before
and in preference to all other items
and for the full amount thereof. The
funds derived from those tax levies
shall be placed in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account of
the Sinking Fund as required by the
General Bond Ordinance, and those
funds, together with the interest collected on them, shall be irrevocably
pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds
when and as the same fall due; provided, however, that, subject to the
provisions of Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in each year to
the extent that revenues are available from other sources for the payment of the Bonds and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount
of such tax shall be reduced by the
amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Ohio Revised Code, and in accordance with the provisions of and to
the extent required or permitted by
the General Bond Ordinance, that
the City will appropriate annually
from the proceeds of the City’s

The City Record
municipal income taxes an amount
as is necessary to meet the annual
debt charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds
are issued. The proceeds of the
Bonds to be applied to pay costs of
any
Credit
Support
Instruments
obtained pursuant to Section 15 hereof shall be paid to the provider or
providers of those Credit Support
Instruments. The proceeds from the
sale of the Bonds to be used to pay
costs of issuing the Bonds shall be
deposited with the Registrar in a
separate account under the Registrar Agreement pending their application to the payment of such costs.
Pursuant to Chapter 133 of the Ohio
Revised Code and this Ordinance,
and notwithstanding Chapter 179 of
the
Codified
Ordinances,
any
accrued interest and any premium
received from the sale of the Bonds
shall be deposited in the Unvoted
Tax Supported Obligations Account
of the Sinking Fund to be applied
to the payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and
agreements provided hereunder and
in the General Bond Ordinance to
secure payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds, the City
hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that the Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit
and general property taxing power
(as described in Section 5) of the
City are hereby pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds in accordance with
the laws and Constitution of the
State of Ohio, this Ordinance and the
General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts

611

25
or subaccounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or subaccounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by an
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest,
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance
for unclaimed funds held by a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment of any Bond as described
in Section 17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section
17(a) for unclaimed funds held by a
Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purpose set forth in
Section 1 hereof, notes of the City
may be issued in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $6,085,000
(the “Notes”) upon the direction of
the Director of Finance to be set
forth in a certificate providing for
the final terms of the Notes and the
sale of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”).
(a) Terms of the Notes. The Notes
shall bear interest at such rate, not
exceeding 5.00% per year, as may be
fixed by the Director of Finance of
the City in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be dated their date of
issuance; shall mature on the date
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award, which shall be no later than
five
years
from
such
date
of
issuance; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior

26
to maturity without penalty, provided that, if the Director of Finance,
based on the advice of a financial
advisor, determines that it is in the
best interest of the City in order to
enhance the marketability of the
Notes, the Director of Finance may
cause
the
Notes
to
not
be
redeemable for a period which ends
no later than the date which is two
years following the date of issuance
of the Notes; shall be designated
“Public
Facilities
Improvement
Bond Anticipation Notes”; shall be
issued in such numbers and denominations as may be requested by the
Note
Purchaser
(hereinafter
defined); and shall be issued in
fully registered form (which may be
in a book-entry only system) in
denominations of $5,000 or integral
multiples thereof. Interest shall be
payable semiannually on the dates
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; provided that if the Notes
mature on or before the end of the
twelfth month following their date
of issuance, interest on the Notes
shall be payable at maturity.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Notes (the
“Note
Registrar”).
The
Escrow
Agent also shall act as paying
agent for the Notes if the Notes are
held in a book-entry system. The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, an agreement among the
City, the Note Registrar and the
Escrow Agent (the “Note Registrar
Agreement”) providing for services
relating to the registration, transfer,
exchange and payment of Notes on
terms that are approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City. That approval shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Note Registrar Agreement by
the Director of Finance. The Director of Finance shall provide for the
payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Note Registrar Agreement from the proceeds
of the Notes to the extent available
and then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to
be appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Note Registrar to maintain and keep at its principal corporate trust office all books and
records necessary for the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes
as provided in this Section (the
“Note Register”). The person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Note
for all purposes of this Ordinance.
Payment of or on account of the
debt charges on any Note shall be
made only to or upon the order of
that person; neither the City nor the
Note Registrar shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary, but the
registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Note Registrar, together with a request for exchange

The City Record
signed by the registered owner or
by a person legally empowered to do
so in a form satisfactory to the Note
Registrar. A Note may be transferred only on the Note Register
upon presentation and surrender of
the Note at the principal corporate
trust office of the Note Registrar
together with an assignment signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer
the Note Registrar shall complete,
authenticate and deliver a new Note
or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested
by the owner equal in the aggregate
to the unmatured principal amount
of the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange
or transfer of Notes only after the
new Notes are signed by the authorized officers of the City. In all
cases of Notes exchanged or transferred, the City shall sign and the
Note Registrar shall authenticate
and deliver Notes in accordance
with the provisions of this Ordinance. The exchange or transfer
shall be without charge to the
owner, except that the City and Note
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Note Registrar may require
that those charges, if any, be paid
before the procedure is begun for
the exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
Ordinance, as the Notes surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Director
of Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City for purposes of their sale
as a single issue to be designated
“Various Purpose General Obligation
Bond Anticipation Notes.” The Notes
shall contain a summary statement
of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the Notes are issued
and shall state that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance.
(b) Execution and Payment of the
Notes. The Notes shall express upon
their faces the purpose for which
they are issued and that they are
issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Each Note shall be authenticated by
the manual signature of an authorized officer of the Trustee (as
defined therein). The Notes shall be
signed by the City’s Mayor and by
the City’s Director of Finance, and,
consistent with Section 133.27 of the
Ohio Revised Code and notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either
or both of those signatures may be
a facsimile. The Notes shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law shall prepare the Notes
and shall endorse thereon the Director of Law’s approval of the form
thereof by the Director of Law’s
manual or facsimile signature.

(c) Sale of the Notes. The Notes
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund
and, if not purchased by them, shall
be offered to the Treasury Investment Account for purchase and, if
not purchased for that Account,
shall be sold to one or more firms
that have proposed to underwrite or
purchase the Notes and have been
selected by the Director of Finance
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those firms (the “Note
Purchaser”) in the principal amount
set forth in a certificate of award to
be executed by the Director of
Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section
10 hereof. The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund
and used for the purpose for which
the Notes are being issued under the
provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Security for the Notes. The
Notes shall be secured by a pledge
and lien on a parity with the
pledges and liens authorized by the
General Bond Ordinance and, in
addition to the taxes and revenues
specifically pledged pursuant to this
Ordinance and the General Bond
Ordinance and the other covenants,
terms
and
agreements
provided
hereunder and in the General Bond
Ordinance to secure payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Notes, the City hereby determines,
declares, warrants and covenants
that the Notes are general obligations of the City and that the full
faith and credit and general property taxing power (as described in
Section 5) of the City are hereby
pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Notes in
accordance with the laws and Constitution of the State of Ohio, this
Ordinance and the General Bond
Ordinance. The par value to be
received from the sale of the Bonds
or of any renewal notes and any
excess funds resulting from the
issuance of the Notes shall, to the
extent necessary, be used to pay the
debt charges on the Notes at maturity and are pledged for that purpose.
Section 10. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes. That tax shall be
and is ordered computed, certified,
levied and extended upon the tax
duplicate and collected by the same
officers, in the same manner and at
the same time that taxes for general purposes for each year are certified, extended and collected. That
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies required
by this Ordinance shall be placed in
the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account, and those funds,
together with the interest collected
on
them,
shall
be
irrevocably
pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of the Notes or the
Bonds in anticipation of which they
are issued, when and as the same
falls due; provided, however, that in

April 25, 2018
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the Notes
and Bonds and are appropriated for
such purpose, the amount of such
direct tax upon all of the taxable
property in the City may be reduced
by the amount of such revenues so
available and appropriated.
Section 11. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a
disclosure document (each, an “Official Statement”) is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
sale of the Notes or the Bonds, the
Director of Finance is authorized to
prepare or cause to be prepared on
behalf of the City an Official Statement with respect to the Notes or
the Bonds, as the case may be, and
any necessary supplements and to
authorize the use and distribution of
each Official Statement and any supplements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
each Official Statement and any supplements approved by her. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of each Official Statement and any supplements as may,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is also
authorized to determine and certify
on behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final”
by the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
The Director of Finance is authorized to contract for services for the
production and distribution of preliminary and final Official Statements, including by printed and
electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes or the Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as
the only obligated person with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds
under the SEC Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information and operating data and
notices, in such manner as may be
required for purposes of the SEC
Rule. In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and to sign
and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate,
which shall constitute the continuing disclosure agreement made by
the City for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of the
Notes or the Bonds, as the case may
be, in accordance with the SEC
Rule.
The
performance
of
that
agreement shall be subject to the
availability of funds and their annual appropriation to meet costs the
City would be required to incur to
perform it. The Director of Finance
is further authorized to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices.

or other credit enhancement instrument as further security for the payment when due of the principal of
and interest on all or any portion of
the Bonds or any Notes (a “Credit

the Bonds or Notes from one or more
nationally recognized rating organizations, and do any and all things
and

actions
required to secure a Credit Support
Instrument and/or a rating or ratings on the Bonds or Notes. The

the payment of any such amounts
from the proceeds of the Bonds or
Notes to the extent available and

and as otherwise permitted by law.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Chapter 133
of the Ohio Revised Code and other
applicable provisions of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Charter of the
City, the General Bond Ordinance
and this Ordinance for the purpose
stated in Section 1 hereof. The
Bonds shall be designated “Bridges
and Roadways Improvement Bonds”
and may contain such further designation as provided in the certificate of award providing for the
final terms of the Bonds and the
sale of the Bonds signed by the
Director of Finance in accordance
with this Ordinance (the “Certificate
of Award”). The Bonds shall be
issued in one lot as fully registered
Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or
any integral multiple thereof. The
Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be issued in the
principal amount specified in the
Certificate of Award, which shall
not exceed the amount stated in Section 1 hereof. The Bonds shall be
dated their date of issuance and
shall bear interest from their date

April 25, 2018
until the principal amount is paid at
the rate or rates per year specified
in the Certificate of Award, provided that the weighted average of
such rates (taking into account the
principal amount and maturity of
each Bond to which a rate applies)
shall not exceed 6.00% per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable when due, or until the principal amount is paid, semiannually
on June 1 and December 1 of each
year that the Bonds are outstanding,
commencing December 1, 2018 (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), unless
otherwise determined by the Director of Finance in the Certificate of
Award.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as
shall be permitted by law and determined by the Director of Finance
and specified in the Certificate of
Award, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor (as defined in
Section 16) to be in the best interests of the City, provided that (i)
each principal payment shall occur
on an Interest Payment Date, (ii)
the first principal payment on the
Bonds shall be no later than August
1, 2020, (iii) the final maturity date
of the Bonds shall be no later than
25 years from that date which is 12
months prior to the first date on
which provision for payment of principal is made, and (iv) the principal
amount thereof shall be payable in
annual installments such that the
total principal and interest payments on the Bonds in any fiscal
year in which principal is payable
is not more than three times the
amount of those payments in any
other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption or purchase prior to stated maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of
100%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds
shall include amounts sufficient to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements

The City Record
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3 hereof) for cancellation
Term Bonds in any aggregate principal amount and to receive a credit against the then-current Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory redemption obligation)
of the City for any Term Bonds.
That option shall be exercised by
the City on or before the forty-fifth
day preceding the applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, by furnishing
the Escrow Agent a certificate,
signed by the Registrar, setting
forth the extent of the credit to be
applied with respect to the then-current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is not timely furnished to
the Escrow Agent, the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds that
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and cancelled by the Registrar, to the
extent not applied theretofore as a
credit
against
any
mandatory
redemption obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and cancelled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100% of the
principal amount thereof against the
then-current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then-current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole or in
part on any date, in integral multiples of $5,000, on the optional
redemption dates and at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date shall not be later than ten
years from the first Interest Payment Date, and the highest redemption price shall not be greater than
102%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed plus accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor, the Director of Finance may
determine
in
the
Certificate
of
Award that it is in the best interests of the City for some or all of
the Bonds not to be callable prior to
their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or

615

29
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar. That notice shall specify
the redemption date and the principal amount of each maturity of
Bonds to be redeemed, and shall be
given at least 45 days prior to the
redemption date or such shorter
period as shall be acceptable to the
Registrar. There shall be deposited
with the Registrar on or prior to the
redemption date funds sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price all
of the redeemable Bonds for which
notice of redemption has been given.
(c) Purchase in Lieu of Redemption. If and to the extent provided
in the Certificate of Award, the City
may elect to purchase Bonds called
for optional redemption in lieu of
redeeming those Bonds. That election shall be exercised by written
direction
from
the
Director
of
Finance to the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent. That written direction shall state whether all or less
than all of the Bonds called for
optional redemption are to be purchased by the City in lieu of
redemption, shall identify the Bonds
to be purchased by their maturity
date and shall specify the principal
amount of each maturity to be purchased in lieu of redemption. If less
than all of the Bonds called for
optional redemption are to be purchased in lieu of redemption, the
amount of each maturity to be purchased shall be in amounts of $5,000
or integral multiples of $5,000. Any
Bonds called for optional redemption that are not to be purchased
shall be redeemed in accordance
with their redemption provisions.
The purchase price of the Bonds to
be purchased in lieu of redemption
shall be equal to the principal of,
any accrued but unpaid interest on,
and any premium that would have
been payable on the Bonds on the
redemption date if the Bonds had
been optionally redeemed instead of
being purchased. No notice of the
purchase in lieu of redemption is
required to be given to the owners
of the Bonds in addition to the
notice of redemption required by
this Ordinance. The Escrow Agent
or Registrar, as paying agent, shall
not purchase Bonds if sufficient
moneys have not been deposited
with the Escrow Agent or Registrar,
as paying agent, by the City for the
purpose. On or prior to the scheduled date for optional redemption,
the City may rescind its direction to
purchase the Bonds in lieu of
redemption by written notice from
the Director of Finance to the Registrar and the Escrow Agent. In the
event that the direction to purchase
is rescinded, the Bonds shall be
redeemed on the redemption date set
forth in the notice of redemption
delivered to the owners of the Bonds
and in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Partial Redemption or Purchase. If fewer than all of the outstanding
Bonds
are
called
for
redemption at one time (whether for
redemption or purchase in lieu of
redemption), they shall be called in

30
the order of maturities directed by
the Director of Finance. If fewer
than all Bonds of a single maturity
are to be redeemed or purchased in
lieu of redemption, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed or purchased,
or portions thereof in amounts of
$5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, shall be made by the Registrar
by lot in a manner determined by
the Registrar. In the case of a partial
redemption
or
purchase
of
Bonds by lot when Bonds of denominations greater than $5,000 are then
outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as
though it were a separate Bond of
the denomination of $5,000. If it is
determined that one or more, but not
all of the $5,000 units of principal
amount represented by a Bond are
to be called for redemption, then
upon notice of redemption of a
$5,000 unit or units, the registered
owner of that Bond shall surrender
the Bond to the Registrar (i) for
payment of the redemption or purchase price of the $5,000 unit or
units called for redemption (including, without limitation, the interest
accrued
to
the
date
fixed
for
redemption and any premium), and
(ii) for issuance, without charge to
the registered owner thereof, of a
new Bond or Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the unmatured portion of the Bond not redeemed or
purchased and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date as the Bond surrendered.
(e) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption
notice
by
first-class
mail, postage prepaid, at least 30
days prior to the date fixed for
redemption (or such period specified
in the Certificate of Award), to the
registered owner of each Bond subject to redemption in whole or in
part
at
the
registered
owner’s
address shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at
the close of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing
and to any provider of a Credit Support Instrument (as defined in Section 15 hereof) for the Bonds or designated portions thereof. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond. Any notice
of redemption of any Bonds may
specify that the redemption is contingent on the deposit of moneys
with the Escrow Agent or Registrar,
as paying agent, on or prior to the
redemption date in an amount sufficient to pay the redemption price
of the Bonds to be redeemed.
(f) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph, and moneys having been
deposited by the City with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying agent, in an amount sufficient

The City Record
to pay the redemption price, the
Bonds and portions thereof called
for redemption shall become due
and payable on the redemption date,
and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or places specified
in that notice, shall be paid. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, including interest accrued
to the redemption date, is held by
the Registrar on the redemption
date, and, if notice of redemption
has been deposited in the mail, then
from and after the redemption date
those Bonds and portions thereof
called for redemption shall cease to
bear interest and no longer shall be
considered to be outstanding. If that
money shall not be so available on
the redemption date, or that notice
shall not have been deposited in the
mail, those Bonds and portions
thereof shall continue to bear interest, until they are paid, at the same
rate as they would have borne had
they not been called for redemption.
All money held by the Registrar for
the redemption of particular Bonds
shall be held in trust for the account
of the registered owners and shall
be paid to them, respectively, upon
presentation and surrender of those
Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3 hereof) at the close of business on
the date provided in the Registrar
Agreement authorized and defined
in Section 3 hereof (the “Record
Date”). Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond
Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are
held by a Depository in a book-entry
system (as described in Section 3
hereof), debt charges on the Bonds
will be payable in lawful money of
the United States by wire transfer
to the Depository made by the
Escrow Agent on each Interest Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance, except for the third paragraph of Section 13(a) (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 (pertaining generally to the periods during which the City is not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), will apply
to the Bonds. Except for those provisions, the General Bond Ordinance
is included as a part of this Ordinance as fully as if restated in this
Ordinance. Words and terms not otherwise defined in this Ordinance
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The

616

April 25, 2018
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee (as
defined therein). The Bonds shall be
signed by the City’s Mayor and by
the City’s Director of Finance, and,
consistent with Section 133.27 of the
Ohio Revised Code and notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either
or both of those signatures may be
a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear
the seal of the City, which seal may
be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s Charter, the
Director of Law shall prepare the
Bonds and shall endorse thereon the
Director of Law’s approval of the
form thereof by the Director of
Law’s manual or facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer
agent and paying agent for the
Bonds
(the
“Registrar”).
The
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book-entry
system. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
an agreement among the City, Registrar and Escrow Agent (the “Registrar Agreement”), approved as to
form by the Director of Law, providing for services relating to the
registration, transfer, exchange and
payment of the Bonds on terms
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City and consistent
with this Ordinance and not substantially adverse to the City. That
approval shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Registrar Agreement by the Director of
Finance. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Registrar Agreement
from the proceeds of the Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the “Bond Register”). The person in whose name a
Bond is registered on the Bond Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Bond for all
purposes of this Ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Bond shall be made only to
or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust

April 25, 2018
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
Ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book-entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book-entry form” or “book-entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book-entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds,
in
book-entry
form,
and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.

The City Record
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book-entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book-entry
system and, if and as long as a
book-entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book-entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book-entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a bookentry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book-entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized to the extent necessary or required to enter into any
agreements determined necessary in
connection with the book-entry system for the Bonds, after determining that the signing thereof will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and after the approval of
the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by them,
shall be offered to the Treasury
Investment Account for purchase
and, if not purchased for that
Account, shall be sold to one or
more firms that have proposed to
underwrite or purchase the Bonds
and have been selected by the Director of Finance based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those
firms (collectively, the “Original
Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance, the written advice
of a financial advisor retained under

617

31
authority of Section 16 hereof and
the Original Purchaser’s offer to
purchase the Bonds, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, the
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount of the Bonds plus any
accrued interest to their date of
delivery), interest rate or rates, the
amounts and years in which principal installments are payable (at
stated
maturity
or
pursuant
to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements), the Interest
Payment Dates and the date of the
Bonds
and
any
other
matters
required in this Ordinance to be set
forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the Charter, the Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of
Law, Clerk of Council and other
appropriate officers of the City are,
and each of them is, authorized to
take such actions as are necessary,
appropriate and in the best interest
of the City to establish the terms
and requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original Purchaser in order to establish the date, location, procedures,
and conditions for the delivery of
the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices
and certificates, to cause a true
transcript of proceedings with reference to the issuance of the Bonds
to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and
other documents and instruments
and to take such actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Ordinance and to take all
steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Bonds. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City a bond purchase agreement
between the City and the Original
Purchaser
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
by the Director of Law, setting forth
the terms and conditions on which
the City agrees to sell the Bonds
and the Original Purchaser agrees
to buy the Bonds, which shall be
consistent with this Ordinance, not
substantially adverse to the City,
and approved by the Director of
Finance on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Bond
Purchase Agreement by the Director
of Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Bonds, as provided in
this Ordinance and as may be provided in or pursuant to the Certificate of Award, are in the best interest of the City and in compliance
with all legal requirements.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Director
of Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 2018”
or such other designation as may be
set forth in the Certificate of Award.
Such bonds shall contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the
Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose

32
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes, a direct
tax annually during the period the
Bonds
are
outstanding,
in
an
amount sufficient to provide for the
payment of that interest, when and
as the same shall fall due, and also
to discharge the principal of the
Bonds at maturity, which tax shall
not be less than the interest and
sinking fund tax required by Section
11 of Article XII of the Constitution
of Ohio.
The tax shall be within the tenmill limitation imposed by law, shall
be and is ordered computed, certified, levied and extended upon the
tax duplicate and collected by the
same officers, in the same manner
and at the same time that taxes for
general purposes for each of those
years are certified, extended and
collected, and shall be placed before
and in preference to all other items
and for the full amount thereof. The
funds derived from those tax levies
shall be placed in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account of
the Sinking Fund as required by the
General Bond Ordinance, and those
funds, together with the interest collected on them, shall be irrevocably
pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds
when and as the same fall due; provided, however, that, subject to the
provisions of Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in each year to
the extent that revenues are available from other sources for the payment of the Bonds and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount
of such tax shall be reduced by the
amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Ohio Revised Code, and in accordance with the provisions of and to
the extent required or permitted by
the General Bond Ordinance, that
the City will appropriate annually
from the proceeds of the City’s
municipal income taxes an amount
as is necessary to meet the annual
debt charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds
are issued. The proceeds of the
Bonds to be applied to pay costs of
any
Credit
Support
Instruments
obtained pursuant to Section 15 hereof shall be paid to the provider or
providers of those Credit Support
Instruments. The proceeds from the
sale of the Bonds to be used to pay
costs of issuing the Bonds shall be
deposited with the Registrar in a
separate account under the Registrar Agreement pending their application to the payment of such costs.
Pursuant to Chapter 133 of the Ohio
Revised Code and this Ordinance,
and notwithstanding Chapter 179 of
the
Codified
Ordinances,
any
accrued interest and any premium
received from the sale of the Bonds
shall be deposited in the Unvoted
Tax Supported Obligations Account

The City Record
of the Sinking Fund to be applied
to the payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and
agreements provided hereunder and
in the General Bond Ordinance to
secure payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds, the City
hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that the Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit
and general property taxing power
(as described in Section 5) of the
City are hereby pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds in accordance with
the laws and Constitution of the
State of Ohio, this Ordinance and the
General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or subaccounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or subaccounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by an
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest,
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such

618

April 25, 2018
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance
for unclaimed funds held by a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment of any Bond as described
in Section 17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section
17(a) for unclaimed funds held by a
Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purpose set forth in
Section 1 hereof, notes of the City
may be issued in an aggregate principal
amount
not
to
exceed
$67,535,000 (the “Notes”) upon the
direction of the Director of Finance
to be set forth in a certificate providing for the final terms of the
Notes and the sale of the Notes and
signed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
(a) Terms of the Notes. The Notes
shall bear interest at such rate, not
exceeding 5.00% per year, as may be
fixed by the Director of Finance of
the City in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be dated their date of
issuance; shall mature on the date
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award, which shall be no later than
five
years
from
such
date
of
issuance; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, provided that, if the Director of Finance,
based on the advice of a financial
advisor, determines that it is in the
best interest of the City in order to
enhance the marketability of the
Notes, the Director of Finance may
cause
the
Notes
to
not
be
redeemable for a period which ends
no later than the date which is two
years following the date of issuance
of the Notes; shall be designated
“Bridges and Roadways Improvement Bond Anticipation Notes”; shall
be issued in such numbers and
denominations as may be requested
by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter
defined); and shall be issued in
fully registered form (which may be
in a book-entry only system) in
denominations of $5,000 or integral
multiples thereof. Interest shall be
payable semiannually on the dates
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; provided that if the Notes
mature on or before the end of the
twelfth month following their date
of issuance, interest on the Notes
shall be payable at maturity.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent

April 25, 2018
and paying agent for the Notes (the
“Note
Registrar”).
The
Escrow
Agent also shall act as paying
agent for the Notes if the Notes are
held in a book-entry system. The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, an agreement among the
City, the Note Registrar and the
Escrow Agent (the “Note Registrar
Agreement”) providing for services
relating to the registration, transfer,
exchange and payment of Notes on
terms that are approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City. That approval shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Note Registrar Agreement by
the Director of Finance. The Director of Finance shall provide for the
payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Note Registrar Agreement from the proceeds
of the Notes to the extent available
and then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to
be appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Note Registrar to maintain and keep at its principal corporate trust office all books and
records necessary for the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes
as provided in this Section (the
“Note Register”). The person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Note
for all purposes of this Ordinance.
Payment of or on account of the
debt charges on any Note shall be
made only to or upon the order of
that person; neither the City nor the
Note Registrar shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary, but the
registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Note Registrar, together with a request for exchange
signed by the registered owner or
by a person legally empowered to do
so in a form satisfactory to the Note
Registrar. A Note may be transferred only on the Note Register
upon presentation and surrender of
the Note at the principal corporate
trust office of the Note Registrar
together with an assignment signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer
the Note Registrar shall complete,
authenticate and deliver a new Note
or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested
by the owner equal in the aggregate
to the unmatured principal amount
of the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange
or transfer of Notes only after the
new Notes are signed by the authorized officers of the City. In all
cases of Notes exchanged or transferred, the City shall sign and the
Note Registrar shall authenticate

The City Record
and deliver Notes in accordance
with the provisions of this Ordinance. The exchange or transfer
shall be without charge to the
owner, except that the City and Note
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Note Registrar may require
that those charges, if any, be paid
before the procedure is begun for
the exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
Ordinance, as the Notes surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Director
of Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City for purposes of their sale
as a single issue to be designated
“Various Purpose General Obligation
Bond Anticipation Notes.” The Notes
shall contain a summary statement
of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the Notes are issued
and shall state that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance.
(b) Execution and Payment of the
Notes. The Notes shall express upon
their faces the purpose for which
they are issued and that they are
issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Each Note shall be authenticated by
the manual signature of an authorized officer of the Trustee (as
defined therein). The Notes shall be
signed by the City’s Mayor and by
the City’s Director of Finance, and,
consistent with Section 133.27 of the
Ohio Revised Code and notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either
or both of those signatures may be
a facsimile. The Notes shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law shall prepare the Notes
and shall endorse thereon the Director of Law’s approval of the form
thereof by the Director of Law’s
manual or facsimile signature.
(c) Sale of the Notes. The Notes
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund
and, if not purchased by them, shall
be offered to the Treasury Investment Account for purchase and, if
not purchased for that Account,
shall be sold to one or more firms
that have proposed to underwrite or
purchase the Notes and have been
selected by the Director of Finance
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those firms (the “Note
Purchaser”) in the principal amount
set forth in a certificate of award to
be executed by the Director of
Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section
10 hereof. The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund
and used for the purpose for which
the Notes are being issued under the
provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Security for the Notes. The
Notes shall be secured by a pledge
and lien on a parity with the
pledges and liens authorized by the
General Bond Ordinance and, in
addition to the taxes and revenues
specifically pledged pursuant to this

619

33
Ordinance and the General Bond
Ordinance and the other covenants,
terms
and
agreements
provided
hereunder and in the General Bond
Ordinance to secure payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Notes, the City hereby determines,
declares, warrants and covenants
that the Notes are general obligations of the City and that the full
faith and credit and general property taxing power (as described in
Section 5) of the City are hereby
pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Notes in
accordance with the laws and Constitution of the State of Ohio, this
Ordinance and the General Bond
Ordinance. The par value to be
received from the sale of the Bonds
or of any renewal notes and any
excess funds resulting from the
issuance of the Notes shall, to the
extent necessary, be used to pay the
debt charges on the Notes at maturity and are pledged for that purpose.
Section 10. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes. That tax shall be
and is ordered computed, certified,
levied and extended upon the tax
duplicate and collected by the same
officers, in the same manner and at
the same time that taxes for general purposes for each year are certified, extended and collected. That
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies required
by this Ordinance shall be placed in
the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account, and those funds,
together with the interest collected
on
them,
shall
be
irrevocably
pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of the Notes or the
Bonds in anticipation of which they
are issued, when and as the same
falls due; provided, however, that in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the Notes
and Bonds and are appropriated for
such purpose, the amount of such
direct tax upon all of the taxable
property in the City may be reduced
by the amount of such revenues so
available and appropriated.
Section 11. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a
disclosure document (each, an “Official Statement”) is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
sale of the Notes or the Bonds, the
Director of Finance is authorized to
prepare or cause to be prepared on
behalf of the City an Official Statement with respect to the Notes or
the Bonds, as the case may be, and
any necessary supplements and to
authorize the use and distribution of
each Official Statement and any supplements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
each Official Statement and any supplements approved by her. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity

34
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of each Official Statement and any supplements as may,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is also
authorized to determine and certify
on behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final”
by the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
The Director of Finance is authorized to contract for services for the
production and distribution of preliminary and final Official Statements, including by printed and
electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes or the Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as
the only obligated person with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds
under the SEC Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information and operating data and
notices, in such manner as may be
required for purposes of the SEC
Rule. In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and to sign
and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate,
which shall constitute the continuing disclosure agreement made by
the City for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of the
Notes or the Bonds, as the case may
be, in accordance with the SEC
Rule.
The
performance
of
that
agreement shall be subject to the
availability of funds and their annual appropriation to meet costs the
City would be required to incur to
perform it. The Director of Finance
is further authorized to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices.
Section 12. Miscellaneous.
(a) Any provisions of the Codified
Ordinances of the City that are
inconsistent with the provisions of
this Ordinance and the General
Bond Ordinance shall not apply to
the Bonds or the Notes authorized
herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance are fully applicable to the
Bonds and the Notes authorized
herein, and nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to alter or
restrict such full application of the
General Bond Ordinance, except for

Covenants. The City covenants that
it will use, and will restrict the use

The City Record
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Bonds in such
manner and to such extent as may
be necessary so that (a) the Notes
and the Bonds will not (i) constitute
private activity bonds or arbitrage
bonds under Sections 141 or 148 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the “Code”) or (ii) be
treated other than as bonds the
interest on which is excluded from
gross income under Section 103 of
the Code, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of
the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the proceeds of the Notes and the
Bonds to the governmental purpose
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield
on
investment
property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds, and, as applicable,
of property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Notes and the Bonds
is hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds
as the City is permitted or required
to make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections available under Section 148 of
the Code, for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax treatment or status of the
Notes and the Bonds or interest
thereon
or
assisting
compliance
with requirements for that purpose,
reducing the burden or expense of
such
compliance,
reducing
the
rebate amount or payments or penalties, or making payments of special
amounts in lieu of making computations to determine, or paying,
excess earnings as rebate, or obviating those amounts or payments, as
determined by that officer, which
action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Notes and the
Bonds, and (c) to give one or more
appropriate certificates of the City,
for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Notes and the
Bonds, setting forth the reasonable
expectations of the City regarding
the amount and use of all the proceeds of the Notes and the Bonds,

interest on and the tax status of the

Section 15. Credit Facilities and
Ratings. If the Director of Finance
determines it to be in the best interests of the City, based on the written advice of a financial advisor, the
Director of Finance may obtain an
insurance policy, letter of credit,
standby bond purchase agreement
or other credit enhancement instrument as further security for the payment when due of the principal of
and interest on all or any portion of
the Bonds or any Notes (a “Credit
Support Instrument”). The Director
of Finance may request a rating on
the Bonds or Notes from one or more
nationally recognized rating organizations, and do any and all things
and
take
any
and
all
actions
required to secure a Credit Support
Instrument and/or a rating or ratings on the Bonds or Notes. The
Director of Finance may enter into

secure Credit Support Instruments
or obtain those ratings is authorized
and approved, and the Director of
Finance is authorized to provide for
the payment of any such amounts
from the proceeds of the Bonds or
Notes to the extent available and
otherwise from any other funds lawfully available that are appropriated or shall be appropriated for that

Director of Finance may rely on the
written advice of any financial advisor so retained. Any financial advisor employed under the authority of
this Ordinance shall be disinterested in the transaction and be independent of the Original Purchasers
and any other party interested in
the transaction.

any other evidence of legislative
intent, it is hereby declared to be
the controlling legislative intent

parts of sections and the application
of such provisions to any other person or circumstance, other than
those as to which it is held invalid,
shall not be affected thereby, and it

City and for which consideration
was duly received by the City prior
to the passage of this Ordinance or

Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Series 2018 Bonds
shall bear interest from their date
until the principal amount is paid at
the rate or rates per year specified

The City Record
The provisions of Sections 9.98 to
9.983 of the Revised Code shall
apply to the Series 2018 Bonds and
pursuant to that authority and this
Ordinance, the Director of Finance
may determine in the Certificate of
Award, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, that the
City’s best interests will be served
by causing all or a portion of the
Series 2018 Bonds to be obligations
bearing interest at variable rates. If
the Director of Finance so determines, then the Director of Finance
shall specify in the Certificate of
Award the method and procedure by
which the variable rate of interest
to be borne by the variable rate
Series 2018 Bonds shall be determined; provided that the variable
rate Series 2018 Bonds shall not bear
interest at a rate in excess of 25%
per year. The Director of Finance is
authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of
the variable rate Series 2018 Bonds,
and from time to time thereafter so
long as the variable rate Series 2018
Bonds
are
outstanding,
with
providers of Credit Support Instruments (as defined in Section 11) and
others as may be determined by the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a financial advisor, to be necessary or appropriate
to provide for the method of determining the variable interest rates,
permitting holders the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of the
variable rate Series 2018 Bonds upon
tender for purchase or redemption,
and providing for the repayment by
the City of any amounts drawn
under the Credit Support Instrument.
The
Series
2018
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award, provided that (i) each
principal payment shall occur on an
Interest Payment Date, and (ii) the
final maturity date of the Series
2018 Bonds shall be no later than
August 1, 2044; provided that the
Series 2018 Bonds shall not have
more
than
25
annual
principal
installments. The Series 2018 Bonds
stated to mature in any year may
be issued as serial Series 2018 Bonds
or
as
term
Series
2018
Bonds
payable prior to stated maturity pursuant to sinking fund redemption
(the “Term Bonds”). The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of
the Series 2018 Bonds shall be issued
as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
If any of the Series 2018 Bonds are
issued as Term Series 2018 Bonds,
the Term Bonds shall be redeemed
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements at a
redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount redeemed, plus
interest accrued to the redemption
date, on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates. The aggregate of the moneys
to be deposited with the Trustee for
payment of principal of and interest
on any Term Bonds shall include

622

April 25, 2018
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the Eleventh Supplement).
The Series 2018 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
redemption dates and at the redemption prices specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. Based on the written advice of
a financial advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the
best interests of the City (i) for
some or all of the Series 2018 Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity, and (ii) for a premium
to be payable on the redemption of
any Series 2018 Bonds calculated in
a manner to make the bondholder
whole for the loss of the investment
or calculated as a percentage in
excess of 100% of the principal
amount redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City
may have the option to purchase
any Bond which is redeemable by
optional redemption at a purchase
price not less than the redemption
price that would be payable if that
Bond
were
called
for
optional
redemption on the date of the proposed purchase. That election shall
be exercised as provided in the
Eleventh Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the Series
2018 Bonds may be secured by a
Debt Service Reserve Fund to be
held by the Trustee under the Indenture. The principal amount of the
Series 2018 Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service
Reserve Fund from the proceeds of
the Series 2018 Bonds, subject to
compliance with applicable federal
tax laws.

enhance the marketability of the
Notes,
that
the
Notes
not
be
redeemable prior to maturity or that

only system). The provisions of Sections 9.98 to 9.983 of the Revised
Code shall apply to the Notes and
pursuant to that authority and this
Ordinance, the Director of Finance
may determine in the Certificate of
Award, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, that the
City’s best interests will be served
by causing all or a portion of the
Notes to be obligations bearing
interest at variable rates. If the
Director of Finance so determines,
then the Director of Finance shall
specify in the Certificate of Award
the method and procedure by which
the variable rate of interest to be
borne by the variable rate Notes
shall be determined; provided that
the variable rate Notes shall not
bear interest at a rate in excess of
25% per year. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Notes,
and from time to time thereafter so
long as the variable rate Notes are
outstanding, with providers of Credit Support Instruments (as defined
in Section 11) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a financial advisor, to be
necessary or appropriate to provide
for the method of determining the
variable interest rates, permitting
holders the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support
for the payment of the variable rate
Notes upon tender for purchase or
redemption, and providing for the
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument. The Trustee
shall be the authenticating agent,
registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes. The Notes shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture. The Notes shall first be

the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
for that Account, shall be sold at not
less than par and accrued interest
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director
of Finance based on an evaluation
of the qualifications of those firms
(the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set forth in a certificate of award to be executed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The proceeds of
such sale shall be paid into the
proper fund or funds set forth in the
Note Certificate of Award and used
for the purpose for which the Notes
are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.

prepared on behalf of the City an
