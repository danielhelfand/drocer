right-of-way, civil penalties for damaged and removed trees, and establishing a Tree Preservation Fund.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances are supplemented by enacting new Sections 341.051, 341.052,
341.053, and 509.21 to read as follows:
Section 341.051 Tree Preservation
Plan Required
(a) For any development project
that meets the criteria of Section
341.02 (“development project”) and
is situated on one (1) or more acres
of land, and for apartment, townhome or condominium projects of
four (4) or more units situated on
any size parcel of land, a Tree
Preservation Plan shall be submitted as part of the Building Permit
application. The Tree Preservation
Plan shall be approved by the Commissioner of Park Maintenance and
Properties
(Commissioner)
or
a
designee before a Building Permit is
issued. A Tree Preservation Plan is
not
required
for
single-family
dwellings, two-family dwellings, and
three-family dwellings or for any
person, firm, or corporation demolishing a building or structure pursuant to a valid demolition permit
issued under Chapter 3115 of this
Code.
(b) The Tree Preservation Plan
shall include: (1) the location, botanical name, dimension at breast
height (DBH), and vertical height
of all existing trees on the property; (2) the intent to preserve, relocate, or replace each tree; (3) measures to be taken to protect new and
mature trees during construction,
and to protect roots and soil during
construction, following Best Management Standards and ANSI Standards for Arboriculture, as may be
amended from time to time; and (4)
any other information the Commissioner or a designee requires to

shall be adhered to during all phases of construction on any development project for which a Tree
Preservation Plan is required.
(c) The Commissioner or designee
shall review all Tree Preservation
Plans and notify the City Planning
Director of approval or disapproval
within thirty (30) business days of
submittal of the Tree Preservation
Plan. When a plan is determined to
be inadequate, written notice of disapproval stating the specific reasons for disapproval shall be communicated to the applicant. The
notice shall specify the modifications, terms and conditions that are

If
approve or disapprove the Tree
Preservation Plan within thirty (30)
business days of its submittal, the
Tree Preservation Plan is deemed
approved.
Section 341.052 Tree Preservation
General Requirements
The following are basic provisions
for the preservation of private and
public trees during construction of
development projects on one (1) or
more acres of land, for apartment,
townhome or condominium projects
of four (4) or more units situated on
any size parcel of land, and for protecting public trees under Section
509.14.
(a) All trees with a DBH of over
six (6) inches shall be preserved,
maintained and protected during
construction, a tree’s roots shall be
protected, and the size of the Tree
Protection Zone shall be, in accordance with Best Management Standards
and
ANSI
Standards
for
Arboriculture, as may be amended
from time to time.
(b) Trees on the property shall
not be removed without prior written approval from the Commissioner
of Park Maintenance and Properties
(Commissioner) or a designee and
only if one (1) or more of the following situations apply:
(1) The tree poses a risk. To verify that a risk exists, the City may
require a tree risk assessment be
performed by the Commissioner or
designee or an International Society
of
Arboriculture
(ISA)-Certified
Arborist with the ISA qualification.
(2) The tree is planted too close
to an existing structure, such that it
is either damaging or has the clear
potential to damage the structure.
(3) The tree inhibits an infrastructure repair due to its proximity to the needed infrastructure
repair. Trees should not be removed
simply because a sidewalk is raised
or cracked, unless it is determined
that removal of the tree is necessary
for the sidewalk repair.
(4) The tree has structural defects
(eg., split trunk, poor branch attachments), is damaged to the point that
it cannot recover and grow properly, or that it will grow in a misshapen or unsightly manner that
could result in failure.
(5) The tree is infested with an
epidemic insect or disease where the
recommended control is not applicable and removal is necessary to prevent transmission of the insect or
disease to other trees. The City may
require this condition to be verified
by the Commissioner or designee or
an ISA-Certified Arborist.
(6)
The
Commissioner
or
a
designee
determines
that
the
removal of the tree is necessary to
carry out construction in compliance
with approved plans.
(c) A person, firm or corporation
may appeal the decision whether to
remove a tree under division (b) to
the Commissioner within 10 business
days of the date of the notice of the
decision. The Commissioner shall
have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse
or modify the decision and shall do
so within 10 days of the date of the
appeal.
A person aggrieved by a

2135

15
final decision of the Commissioner
may further appeal to the Board of
Zoning Appeals within thirty (30)
days after the Commissioner’s decision.
(d) A tree that is removed shall
be replaced with a tree of appropriate species as selected by the Commissioner or designee and in a location where it will grow to replace
the removed tree without posing the
for
which
the
tree
was
risks
removed. Instead of replacing a tree
removed pursuant to this section, a
developer may pay the City the
value of the tree as established
using the Trunk Formula Method
outlined in The Guide for Plant
Appraisal by the Council of Tree
and Landscape Appraisers, as may
be amended from time to time, or
other tree replacement analysis provided by similar publication. All
funds collected pursuant to this division shall be deposited in the Tree
Preservation
Fund
established
under Chapter 509 of the Codified
Ordinances.
Section 341.053 Civil Penalties for
Damaged Trees or Trees Removed
Without Approval
(a) Any person, firm, or corporation required to submit a Tree
Preservation Plan that damages a
tree located in the development site,
due to the failure to properly protect or maintain the tree during construction pursuant to Section 341.052,
whether by negligence or otherwise,
shall be charged one thousand dollars ($1000.00) per area of damage
to the above ground portion of the
tree. If the damage can be repaired
or reduced following Best Management Standards and ANSI Standards
for Arboriculture, as may be amended from time to time, the party
responsible for the damage shall
hire an ISA-Certified Arborist to
repair or reduce the damage at the
cost of the responsible party. If the
damage to the tree is adequately
repaired
by
the
ISA-Certified
Arborist, in the discretion of the
Commissioner of Park Maintenance
and Properties (Commissioner) or
designee, the Commissioner may
waive the civil fine.
(b) Any person, firm, or corporation required to submit a Tree
Preservation Plan that harms a tree
within the development site by failing to properly protect the roots in
violation of Section 341.052 or division (e) of Section 352.05, such that
an ISA-Certified Arborist believes
the tree will fall or decline and die
within two (2) calendar years of the
date of completion of construction,
shall be charged the full value of
the tree as established using the
Trunk Formula Method outlined in
The Guide for Plant Appraisal by
the Council of Tree and Landscape
Appraisers, as may be amended
from time to time, or other tree
replacement analysis provided by
similar publication.
(c) Any person, firm or corporation required to submit a Tree
Preservation Plan that removes any
tree located in the development site
in violation of Section 341.052, shall
be charged a civil fine of $1,000 for
each tree removed in addition to the
full cost of any removed tree based
on the replacement cost of the tree
as established using the Trunk Formula Method outlined in The Guide
for Plant Appraisal by the Council

16
of Tree and Landscape Appraisers,
as may be amended from time to
time, or other tree replacement
analysis provided by similar publication.
(d)
The
Commissioner
or
a
designee shall have the authority to
charge the civil fines set forth in
this section. All civil fines and costs
collected pursuant to this section
shall be deposited in the Tree
Preservation
Fund
established
under Chapter 509 of the Codified
Ordinances.
(e) A person, firm or corporation
required to submit a Tree Preservation Plan that receives a civil fine
under this section may appeal to the
Commissioner within 10 business
days of the date of the notice of the
civil fine. The Commissioner shall
have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse,
or modify the decision and shall do
so within 10 days of the date of the
appeal. A person aggrieved by a
final decision of the Commissioner
may further appeal to the Board of
Zoning Appeals within thirty (30)
days after the Commissioner’s decision.
Section 509.21 Tree Preservation
Fund
The Director of Finance shall
establish a Tree Preservation Fund
for the purpose of supporting the
preservation,
protection,
maintenance, purchase and planting of
trees in the City. Civil fines and
funds collected as a result of damage to trees or removal of trees in
violation of, or to adhere to, applicable sections of this Code, shall be
deposited in the Tree Preservation
Fund for disbursement as set forth
in this section. Any person, firm, or
corporation may make contributions
to the Tree Preservation Fund and
the Director of Finance is authorized to accept contributions to the
Tree Preservation Fund for the purposes set forth in this section.

Section 161.05 Regulation of Environmental Changes; Certificate of
Appropriateness
No person owning, renting or occupying property which has been designated a landmark or which is situated in a designated landmark district shall make any environmental
change in such property unless a
certificate of appropriateness has
been previously issued by the Commission with respect to such environmental change. The following
procedures shall apply to all alterations, demolitions, removals or constructions of such property in the
City:

The City Record
(a) Any application to the Department of Building and Housing for a
building permit for an environmental change shall also be deemed an
for
a
certificate
of
application
appropriateness, and shall be forwarded to the Commission, together
with copies of all detailed plans,
designs, elevations, specifications
and documents relating thereto, and,
for any environmental change on
one (1) or more acres of land, and
for any environmental change to an
apartment, townhome or condominium of four (4) or more units situated on any size parcel of land, a
copy of a Tree Preservation Plan
meeting the requirements set forth
in Section 341.051, within seven (7)
days after receipt of the application.
An application for a certificate of
appropriateness may be filed by the
applicant directly with the Commission at the same time that an application for a building permit is filed
or in lieu of filing for a building
permit, if no building permit is
required for the proposed environmental change. The Commissioner
of Park Maintenance and Properties
or a designee shall review any Tree
Preservation Plan and shall notify
the Director of Building and Housing of approval or disapproval as
set forth in Section 341.051. The general requirements of tree preservation in Section 341.052 shall apply to
any person seeking to make an environmental change on one (1) or
more acres of land, and to any person seeking to make an environmental change to an apartment,
townhome or condominium of four
(4) or more units situated on any
size parcel of land.
(b) The Commission shall evaluate
applications
to
determine
whether or not the environmental
change proposed by the applicant
will adversely affect any significant
historical or aesthetic feature of the
property and to determine whether
or not the environmental change
proposed by the applicant is consistent with the spirit and purposes of
this chapter.
(1) In evaluating applications for
alterations or construction of property, the Commission shall consider
the following standards created by
the U.S. Department of the Interior:
A. A property shall be used for its
historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal
change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and
environment;
B. The historic character of a
property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic
materials or alternation of features
and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided;
C. Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its
time, place, and use. Changes that
create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural
elements from other buildings, shall
not be undertaken;
D. Most properties change over
time;
those
changes
that
have
acquired historic significance in
their own right shall be retained
and preserved;
E. Distinctive features, finishes,
and
construction
techniques
or
examples
of
craftsmanship
that
characterize a property shall be preserved;

2136

December 12, 2018
F. Deteriorated historic features
be
repaired
rather
than
shall
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature
shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities
and,
where
possible,
materials.
Replacement of missing features
shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence;
G. Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that
cause damage to historic materials
shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate,
shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible;
Significant
archaeological
H.
resources affected by a project shall
be protected and preserved. If such
resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken;
I. New additions, exterior, alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials
that characterize the property. The
new work shall be differentiated
from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale,
and architectural features to protect
the historic integrity of the property and its environment; and
J. New additions and adjacent or
related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that
if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment
would be unimpaired.
(2) In evaluating applications for
demolition or removal of property,
the Commission shall consider the
following standards:
A. The architectural and historic
significance of the subject building
or structure;
B. The significance of the building or structure in contributing to
the architectural or historic character of its environs;
C. In the case of a request to move
a building or other structure, the
relationship between the location of
the subject building or structure and
its overall significance;
D. The present and potential economic viability of the subject building or structure, given its physical
condition and marketability;
E. If the demolition will remedy
conditions imminently dangerous to
life, health, or property, as determined in writing by the Department
of Building and Housing, the Division of Fire or the Department of
Public Health; and
F. The appropriateness of the proposed new structure or use and its
impact on the surrounding community.
(c) If the Commission finds that
the environmental change proposed
by the applicant will not adversely
affect any significant historical or
aesthetic feature of the property and
is appropriate and consistent with
the spirit and purposes of this chapter, or will remedy conditions imminently dangerous to life, health or
property, as determined in writing
by the Department of Building and
Housing or the Division of Fire or
the Department of Public Health,
then the Commission shall issue a
certificate of appropriateness.
(d) If the Commission finds that
the environmental change proposed
by the applicant will adversely
affect any significant historical or

December 12, 2018
aesthetic feature of the property or
is inappropriate or inconsistent with
the spirit and purposes of this chapter, the Commission may either deny
the application or delay action on
the application. Any decision to
delay action on the application shall
be by mutual agreement of the Commission and the applicant and shall
be for a period not to exceed six (6)
months. During the delay period, the
Commission shall conduct further
investigation with regard to the proposed environmental change, conduct negotiations with the applicant
and any other party in an effort to
find a means of preserving the property, or explore alternatives to the
proposed environmental change. The
Commission may also investigate
the feasibility of all available ways
and
means
of
preserving
the
improvement, including without limitation, inducing by contract or
other consideration the creation of
covenants restricting the use of
property, leasing and subleasing the
property for the purposes of preservation and acquiring by eminent
domain or contract or conveyance
all or any part of or interest in the
property.
(e) At the end of the delay period, the Commission shall either
approve or deny the application, or
delay action. A decision to delay
action, at the end of one (1) delay
period, shall be by mutual agreement of the Commission and the
applicant and shall be for a period
not to exceed six (6) months. The
Commission shall only agree to a
second and final delay period if the
Commission determines that this
additional time period may be useful in securing an alternative to the
proposed environmental change. At
the end of the second and final
delay period, the Commission shall
either approve or deny the application for a certificate of appropriateness.
(f) Upon the issuance, denial or a
delay in the issuance of a certificate
of appropriateness, the Commission
shall give written notices of the
issuance, denial or delay in the
issuance to the applicant and the
Department of Building and Housing. The Commission shall provide
written
notice
of
the
issuance,
denial or delay in the issuance of a
certificate of appropriateness to the
applicant and the Department of
Building and Housing within fortyfive (45) days of the receipt by the
Commission of an application from
either the applicant or the Department of Building and Housing.
(g) If no action has been taken
by the Commission on an application for a certificate of appropriateness to approve, deny or delay
action within forty-five (45) days
after such application has been
received by the Commission, the certificate of appropriateness shall be
deemed issued.

Project Description
In 1899, David May, the founder of
May Department Stores, acquired E.
R. Hull & Dutton Co. of Cleveland
on Ontario Street, renaming it May
Company, Cleveland. Built in 1914,
the high-rise building stands 149
feet and contains 8 floors of space,
though floors 7 and 8 were not
added until 1931. The May Company
specialized in mid to higher end
fashion merchandise and home furnishings. May Company was the
first local department store to issue
its own personal charge card in
1965. The building was added to the
National Register of Historic Places
in 1974. However, on January 31,
1993
May
Company,
Ohio
was
merged into Kaufmann’s of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the downtown Cleveland store was closed
The May Company building was
acquired last year for $12 million by
Bedrock-Detroit LLC, a real estate
company. The redevelopment plans
by subsidiary Haddas Windowpane,
LLC , call to convert the property
into 308 apartments, ranging from
one to three bedrooms. The building
also features an interior garage
with entrance off Prospect Avenue
that features 522 spaces on floors
two through five. The roof of the
garage on the sixth floor will be
converted into green space open for
residents to use. Other outdoor
spaces on the 9th-floor rooftop space
will enable entertaining, some of
which will be open to the public.
Floor plans call for 40,000 additional square feet of retail, including a
rooftop space for a food-and-beverage tenant. Other retailers would
face Euclid and Prospect and flank
an interior corridor cutting through
the building’s first floor, which
spans more than an acre.

The Statler Arms building is one
of the oldest residential buildings in
Downtown Cleveland. The building
opened in 1912 as Hotel Statler
along
Cleveland’s
storied
main
street, at the intersection of East
12th and Euclid. The building functioned as the Statler Tower, an
office building, from approximately
1971 through 2001, when it was converted into an apartment building.
The projects location in Playhouse
Square along the Euclid Avenue
transit corridor makes it a prime
opportunity for renovated apartment
units. The total project investment
is expected to exceed $56 million.
