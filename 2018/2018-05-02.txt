of the nuisance property and may be
certified as a lien on the nuisance
property. Notice shall be deemed
properly delivered by delivering it
personally to the owner or leaving
it at the owner's usual place of
business or residence, or by mailing

it to the owner, or, if it cannot be
served in any of the other ways
mentioned above, by publishing it
once in a newspaper of general circulation within the City, or by posting it in a conspicuous place on the
real estate involved. The notice
shall also set forth the civil fines if
a fifth or any subsequent nuisance
activity occurs within six months of
the date of the notice of a charge
for the cost of abatement issued
under division (b) of this section.
(b) Abatement. If the Director of
Public Safety or his or her designee
determines that a fourth or subsequent nuisance activity as defined
in Section 630.01 occurs later than
thirteen (13) days after the date of
the initial written nuisance declaration notice and within twelve (12)
six (6) months after the date of the
third or any subsequent nuisance
activity, the City may abate the nuisance activity by using administrative and law enforcement actions,
and the costs of the abatement shall
be charged to the owner of the property and, if not paid, may be certified by the Commissioner of Assessments and Licenses to the County
Auditor to be placed on the nuisance
property as a lien to be collected as
other taxes and returned to the City.
The cost to abate the nuisance activity shall be calculated as set forth
in division (c). The City shall provide notice to the owner of the nuisance property of the City's decision
to charge the cost of abatement. If
the costs are not paid by the owner,
the City shall notify the owner at
least thirty (30) days before the
costs are certified to the County
Auditor. The notice shall contain a
street address or legal description of
the property, a description of the
nuisance activities and the cost to
abate. Notices shall be served as set
forth in division (a) of this section.
The Director of Law may take any
other action necessary to collect the
costs of abatement.
(c) Costs of Abatement. Costs of
abatement
shall
be
determined
based on the time required to
respond to the nuisance activity
multiplied by an hourly rate based
upon the wages and benefits of a
police officer, dispatch costs, vehicle
and equipment costs, and supervisory and administrative costs. The
hourly rate may be adjusted based
on the number of police officers
required to abate the nuisance.
(d) Nuisance Abatement Plan. The
owner of a nuisance property may
avoid being charged the cost of
abating future nuisances if the
owner meets with the Director of
Public Safety or his or her designee;
presents a plan to prevent further
nuisance activity and that plan is
approved by the Director of Public
Safety or his or her designee; and
implements the plan.
(e) Civil Fine. If the Director of
Public Safety or his or her designee
determines that a fifth or subsequent nuisance activity as defined
in Section 630.01 occurs within 6
months after the date of the notice
of a charge for the cost of abatement, a property owner shall be
charged
five
hundred
dollars
($500.00) for a fifth nuisance activity, seven hundred fifty dollars
($750.00) for a sixth nuisance activity
and
one
thousand
dollars
($1,000.00) for a seventh or any subsequent nuisance activity occurring

on the same property. This fine is
in addition to the costs of abatement
that may be charged and, if the fine
is not paid, shall be certified to the
County Auditor as set forth in division (b) of this section. Fines are
subject to appeal as set forth in
division (f) of this section.
(e) (f) Appeal. The owner of a nuisance
property
who
receives
a
notice declaring the owner's property to be a nuisance property, a
notice charging the cost of abating
nuisance activity, or a notice that
the cost of abatement shall be certified to the County Auditor, a
notice charging a fine for a fifth or
subsequent nuisance activity, or a
notice that a fine shall be certified
to the County Auditor, may appeal
the notice by submitting a written
request to the City official who
issued the notice within ten (10)
days of the date of the notice. If,
after a decision on that appeal, the
owner disagrees with the decision,
the owner may appeal the decision
of the City official to the Board of
Zoning Appeals. An appeal to the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall be
made within fifteen (15) days of the
postmark date of the decision from
the City official denying the appeal.
The Board shall conduct a hearing
and render a decision in accordance
with City ordinances and regulations governing its conduct and procedure. An appeal to the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall not stay any
actions by the City to abate any subsequent nuisance activity. In an any
appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals of a nuisance declaration
notice, the City must show by a preponderance of the evidence that
there was probable cause to believe

that each nuisance activity stated in
the
notice
being
appealed
has
occurred, and that the declaration of
the property as a nuisance property
is justified. In an appeal to the
Board of Zoning Appeals of a notice
charging the cost of abating nuisance activity, or a notice that the
cost of abatement shall be certified
to the County Auditor, the City must
show by a preponderance of the evidence , or that the charging of
abatement costs and fines, if applicable, or the certification of abatement costs and fines, if applicable,
is justified. The owner may prevail
on appeal of any notice if the owner
demonstrates by a preponderance of
the evidence that:
(1) He or she was not the owner
at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the
notice; or
(2) He or she had knowledge of
the nuisance activity, but promptly
and vigorously took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance activity
including,
without
limitation,
compliance with the requirements of
RC 5321.17(C) and RC 5321.04(A)(9);
or
(3) He or she had no knowledge
of the nuisance activity and could
not, with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance
activity; and upon receipt of the
notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance property, he or
she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance including, without limitation, compliance
with
the
requirements
of
RC
5321.17(C) and RC 5321.04(A)(9).

FIRST READING ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 572-18.
By Council Member Brancatelli (by departmental request).
An ordinance to repeal Section 337.031 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by Ordinance No. 1844-02, passed May 12, 2003, relating to Townhouse (RA) Districts; and to supplement the codified ordinances by enacting new Section 337.031, relating to Townhouse (RA) Districts.
Be it ordained by the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 337.031 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by Ordinance
No. 1844-02, passed May 12, 2003, is repealed.
Section 2. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are supplemented by enacting new Section
337.031 to read as follows:
Section 337.031 Townhouse (RA) Districts)
(a) Purpose. Townhouse Districts (i.e., Residential Attached Districts) are established to set the requirements
for the form, site plan and building features of townhouse developments.
Safe sidewalks, inviting streets and compelling urban form are essential elements of vibrant, walkable urban
neighborhoods. The inherent density of townhouses is a key component of this vision, but without thoughtful site
planning and design, this goal will not be fully realized. The provisions of this section are intended to make
these elements the standards for developments in Cleveland’s neighborhoods.
(b) Definitions.
(1) “Townhouse Unit” is a single or two (2) family dwelling on its own lot, served by its own exclusive exterior pedestrian entrance, and attached to one (1) or more other such units by fire walls or fire separation walls.
(2) “Townhouse Building” is a building composed of two (2) or more townhouse units.
(3) “Principal Pedestrian Entrance” is the exterior door exclusive to the dwelling unit that offers a pedestrian
the most visible and direct means of ingress and egress to a public right of way.
(4) “Principal Street Frontage” is the Street Line where the Townhouse Unit’s Principal Pedestrian Entrance
is located. Where a townhouse has a lot line abutting a Public Space, that frontage shall be regulated as a Principal Street Frontage.
(5) "Secondary Street Frontage" means that on corner lots, all street lines that are not the Principal Frontage
are considered Secondary Street Frontages; also known as the side street frontage.
(6) “Interior Frontage” For lots fronting an Alley or without a Street Line, the Interior Frontage is the frontage
of a townhouse where the Principal Pedestrian Entrance is located.
(7) "Frontage build-out" means the portion of the Principal and Secondary Street Frontage containing a building.

661

(8) “Active Uses” are those habitable spaces of a dwelling most often used for living, eating or cooking. These
spaces encourage ‘eyes on the street’ and include such spaces as living rooms, offices, kitchens, or similar. Nonhabitable spaces, garages, hallways, corridors, bathrooms, closets, storage, mechanical rooms, utility spaces, or
similar are not considered Active Uses.
(9) “Human-scaled materials” are defined as twelve inch (12") maximum width in either the vertical or the horizontal dimension. The other dimension is unlimited. Examples include brick, stone, wood, fiber-cement lap siding, terra cotta, or similar materials.
(c) District Establishment.
The following Townhouse Districts are hereby established: RA-1, RA-2, and RA-3 (with the abbreviation “RA”
indicating “Residential, Attached and the numeral indicating that the districts are listed in order of “densite,”
from lowest to highest.”).
(d) Permitted uses in all RA Districts.

(e) Site Planning and Design
No Building Permit shall be issued for the original construction of a townhouse unit or Townhouse Building
without approval of the Director of the City Planning Commission, which shall seek to ensure that the development meets the spirit and intent of subsection (a) by applying the standards set forth below:
(1) Compatibility. The development shall be visually compatible with nearby properties with respect to such
design elements as scale, height, setbacks, orientation to existing streets, roof lines, architectural character, materials, colors, and proportions of architectural features.
(2) Site Layout. Buildings, structures and landscape features shall be arranged so as to create visual interest,
promote security and personal safety, promote safe, efficient, and comfortable pedestrian circulation, facilitate
safe and efficient vehicular circulation, conserve natural features and provide usable common and private open
space.
(3) Building Features. Townhouse units shall contribute to the character of the neighborhood by drawing from
the best examples of architecture and urbanism. Townhouse units shall be designed to create active, attractive,
street frontages that promote safety and walkability using the essential elements of traditional urban architecture as regulated in division (g) of this code.
(4) Circulation and Parking. Circulation and parking shall be designed to achieve the following:
A. Provide proper access for service and safety vehicles
B. Minimize conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles
C. Minimize the number of curb cuts
D. Maximize opportunities for on-street parking and street trees by prohibiting front loaded garages and unenclosed parking in front yards.

(3) Administrative Modifications. The Director of City Planning may require a numerical standard that is different from the standard under section (f) of up to twenty (20) percent in any direction if it is determined that
such relief will result in a townhouse or townhouse building that is more appropriately situated and/or more consistent with its context. This provision shall not apply to section (f)(3)F.
Example application of Director discretion:
In the RA-3 District the Director may administratively reduce the required Interior Front Yard Depth from the
numerical standard of 7' to 5'7" (7' x 0.8 =5' 7").
(g) Procedures and Appeals
(1) Application of the RA Code. In all zoning districts other than a mapped Townhouse District, proposed townhouse developments shall be reviewed under the RA District whose front yard setback in section (g)(2)A. most
closely matches or complements the zoning district of the proposed development as determined by the Director
of City Planning. To determine which RA District the development shall be reviewed under:
A. Determine the existing typical front yard setback of the zoning district of the proposed development.
B. For proposals to be constructed at mid-block, the RA District whose front yard setback range most closely
aligns with the setback of the existing buildings on the block shall be applied.
C. For proposals to be constructed on corners, context from the buildings on the adjacent corners of the intersection as well as those buildings on the specific block should be considered, and the RA District whose front
yard setback range most closely aligns with the front yard setback of the existing buildings at the intersection
shall be applied.
(2) Townhouses in Single or Two Family Districts. In any zoning district where a townhouse use is not permitted by right (ex. Single Family, Two Family), the City Planning Commission shall determine, based on the
application of section (e) of this Chapter, if a townhouse use shall be permitted.
Section 3. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by
law.

An emergency resolution honoring
Representative Marcy Kaptur of
Ohio’s Ninth Congressional District
for becoming the longest serving
woman in the history of the United
States House of Representatives.
Whereas, Representative Marcy
Kaptur, who represents Ohio’s Ninth
Congressional
District
that
surrounds the Lake Erie coastline from
Cleveland to Toledo, has shattered
the record for the longest serving
woman in the history of the United
States House of Representatives;
and
Whereas, first elected in 1982,
Kaptur has served 18 terms under
six presidents, and after serving 35
years, two months and 15 days, has
surpassed the record set by the late
Representative
Edith
Nourse
Rogers; and
Whereas, the daughter of a Polish-American working-class family
in Toledo, Kaptur became the first
member of her family to graduate
from college, earning degrees from
the University of Wisconsin and the
University of Michigan; and
Whereas,
Kaptur
is
the
first
Democratic woman ever to serve on
the powerful Defense Subcommittee,
where she is a strong advocate for
national security, energy independence, and adequate support for the
armed forces; and
Whereas, she is also a member of
the House Appropriations Committee, the ranking member on the
Energy and Water Appropriations
Subcommittee, and the Interior Subcommittee where she fights for
clean water programs that protect
our Great Lakes; and
Whereas, Representative Kaptur
is widely credited with bringing
back federal dollars to partner with
local communities on crucial transportation and infrastructure projects, and is known for her dedication during the long legislative battle she waged to have the World
War II memorial built on the
National Mall in Washington, D.C.;
and

36
Whereas, this Council wishes to
honor Representative Marcy Kaptur
as she marks the milestone of
becoming
the
longest
serving
woman in the history of the United
States House of Representatives;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland
Section 1. That this Council honors Representative Marcy Kaptur of
Ohio’s Ninth Congressional District
for becoming the longest serving
woman in the history of the United
States House of Representatives.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to Representative
Marcy Kaptur, Ohio’s Ninth Congressional District.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

By Council Member Polensek.
An emergency resolution supporting House Bill 560 to prohibit pet
food from containing remains from
an animal that was euthanized by
the use of any drug injected intravenously or through another nonvascular route or remains from any dog
or cat.
Whereas, currently, it is legal in
Ohio for dog and cat remains to be
put into pet food; and
Whereas, the euthanizing drug
pentobarbital has turned up in pet
food and some veterinarians have
reported animals getting sick from
eating it; and
Whereas, for years, veterinarians
have reported that it is harder to
put down an animal, which may be
because some have built up a resistance to the pentobarbital that is in
the pet food because it is in the
euthanized animals used to make
the pet food; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland
Section 1. That this Council supports House Bill 560 to prohibit pet
food from containing remains from
an animal that was euthanized by
the use of any drug injected intravenously or through another nonvascular route or remains from any
dog or cat.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to all members of the Ohio legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,

The City Record
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

Res. No. 472-18.
By Council Member Kazy.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Senate to pass House Bill
38 to provide that purposely causing
the death of a first responder or military member is aggravated murder,
and to require an offender to serve
a mandatory prison term for certain
types
of
felonious
assault
or
attempted aggravated murder when
the victim is a first responder or
military member.
Whereas, House Bill 38, sponsored
by Representative David Greenspan,
was passed by the Ohio House of
Representatives on May 17, 2017,
and is pending passage in the Ohio
Senate after several hearings; and
Whereas, House Bill 38 expands
the offense of aggravated murder to
also include purposely causing the
death of a first responder or military member whom the offender
knows is a first responder or military member and it is the offender’s
specific purpose to kill a person in
that capacity; and
Whereas, the bill expands the
offense of aggravated murder based
on purposely causing the death of a
law enforcement officer whom the
offender knows or has reasonable
cause to know is such an officer to
also apply when the victim is a federal law enforcement officer or a
person who previously served in
either capacity; and
Whereas, House Bill 38 requires a
mandatory prison term of three to
11 years for an attempt to commit
aggravated murder of the type
described in either of the two preceding clauses; and
Whereas, it also increases the
penalty for felonious assault against
a first responder or military member from a second degree felony,
absent any specification, to a first
degree felony if the offender specifically targeted the victim for being
a first responder or military member; and
Whereas,
the
bill
requires
a
mandatory prison term of three to
11
years
for
felonious
assault
against a first responder or military
member if the offender specifically
targeted the victim for being a first
responder or military member and
the victim suffered serious physical
harm; and
Whereas, lastly, House Bill 38 provides that the first degree felony
penalty for felonious assault against
a peace officer or BCII investigator,
and the three to 11-year mandatory
prison term that applies when such
a victim suffers serious physical
harm, also apply when the victim is
a federal law enforcement officer or
a person who previously served in
any of those capacities; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the need for justice for first responders and military members who are
purposefully killed; therefore we
urge the Ohio Senate to pass House
Bill 38; and

684

May 2, 2018
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the

38 to provide that purposely causing

Representatives.
