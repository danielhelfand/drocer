An
emergency
ordinance
authorizing the Director of Port
Control to enter into one or more
contracts without competitive bidding
with United Airlines, Inc. for the
purchase of two used passenger
loading bridges, for the Division of
Cleveland
Hopkins
International
Airport, Department of Port Control.
Whereas, in 2016, United Airlines,
Inc. (“United”) reduced the number
of gates it leased from the City of
Cleveland, Department of Port Control, at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport (the “Airport”) and
removed
its
passenger
loading
bridges (aka “jetbridges”) from all
such unleased gates except gates C10 and C-14; and
Whereas, the Airport is using the
gates no longer leased by United,
returned to Airport control, to meet
significantly increased immediate
and anticipated demand by various
airlines for common-use gates resulting from the addition of new air carriers and of new flights by existing
air carriers at the Airport, and for
overflow gate use by United; and
Whereas, to operate gates C-10
and C-14 to provide adequate facilities to meet immediate and anticipated
airline
demand
for
fully
equipped common-use gates, the City
requires ownership and control of
the jetbridges attached to those gate
premises and currently in service;
and
Whereas, United is willing to sell
the jetbridges and necessary associated equipment at both gate C-10
and gate C-14 to the City Department of Port Control for the consideration of $130,000.00, which amount
two jetbridge maintenance and supply firms have agreed is fair market value; and
Whereas, purchase of the jetbridges currently in use at gates C10 and C-14 will maintain immediate
availability of those gates for common use and avoid the time delay
and costs of purchase and delivery
of jetbridges on the open market;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council determines that the within commodities
are non-competitive and cannot be
secured from any source other than

The City Record
United Airlines, Inc. Therefore the
Director of Port Control is authorized to make one or more written
contracts with United Airlines, Inc.
for the purchase of two (2) jetbridges at Gates C-10 and C-14 at
Cleveland
Hopkins
International
Airport, for a total sum not to
exceed $130,000.00, to be purchased
by the Commissioner of Purchases
and Supplies, for the Division of

societies
or

symphony orchestras and receiving
substantial support from voluntary
contributions, or of improving any
municipal
corporation,
or
of
maintaining
a
cooperative
or
community center, moving picture
theater, or swimming pool, if no part
of the net earnings thereof inures to
the benefit of any private stockholder
or individual;
(2) Exclusively to the benefit of
persons in the military or naval forces
of the United States, or of National
Guard organizations, reserve officer
associations or posts or organizations
of war veterans or auxiliary units or
societies of any such posts or

(3) Exclusively to the benefit of
members of the police or fire

municipal corporation under the
control of a recreation commission.
(5) Exclusively to a small capacity

voice, instruments, or dance. If the
same active performance is occurring
for the benefit of more than one
separate room, then those separate
rooms shall be considered together as
one venue.
(b) (1) The exemption from tax
provided
by
this
section
shall,
however, not be allowed in case of
admissions to wrestling matches,
prize fights or boxing, sparring or
other

forth in division (a)(2) of this section,
nor in the case of admissions to any

(2)
The

section shall, however, not be allowed
in case of admissions to museums
located on land leased by the City
pursuant to a lease agreement entered
into after August 21, 1991.
(c) Immediately after the event for
which an exemption from admission
tax has been allowed, upon the
demand of the Commissioner of
Assessments
and
Licenses,
the
treasurer of the institution, society or
organization for whose benefit such
event was held shall file an itemized
statement with the Commissioner
setting forth the amount of money
actually received by such treasurer
together
with
the
expenses
of
promoting and conducting such event.
Such statement shall be used as a
basis of subsequent requests for
exemption from admissions tax for the
benefit of such institution, society or

promoting and conducting such event,
in relation to the profits, if any, no
such exemption shall thereafter be

(d) The exemption from tax
provided in this section shall not be
allowed to any institution, society or
organization which does not control

services or other items.
(e) The limitation contained in this
section, upon the exemption from tax
in case of admissions to wrestling
matches, prize fights or boxing,
sparring or other pugilistic matches or
exhibitions, shall not be deemed to
apply to any such matches or
exhibitions
in
which
all
the
contestants are amateurs and the

a legitimate charitable purpose,
excepting therefrom the necessary
expenses, which shall in no event
include payment to any contestant
other than his or her necessary
traveling expenses.

“Three-Party
Agreement”),

(f) at the times and in the manner that
such taxes would have been payable

event that the City increases the taxes
payable under this chapter from six
percent (6%) to a higher rate, the
percentage equal to such increase
times all admissions charges for all
admissions during such Collection
Year to the Gateway Arena for Games,
and plus (c) in the event that the City
increases the taxes payable under this
chapter from six percent (6%) to a
higher rate, the percentage equal to
such increase times all admissions
charges for all admissions during
such Collection Year to the Gateway
Arena for any events other than

purpose during such Bond Year,

in such form as are consistent with

Johnson, Brady, Brancatelli, Kelley,
Cummins, Zone, Kazy, and Keane.
An emergency resolution calling
upon the Ohio Department of Health
to fully restore Ryan White Part B
funding for fiscal year 2017-2018 to
the AIDS Taskforce of Greater
Cleveland.
Whereas, recently the AIDS Taskforce of Greater Cleveland (ATGC)
was given verbal notice that in the
next 30 days it will not continue to
receive Ryan White Part B funding;
and
Whereas, this notification from
the Ohio Department of Health
comes without any written justification in response to the ATGC’s
strong and competitive application
for Ryan White Part B funding; and
Whereas, for nearly 35 years, the
ATGC has served the greater Cleveland metropolitan area with excellence in community and public
health service; and
Whereas, despite fluctuating government support, the ATGC has tirelessly advocated for and served
thousands of people living with
HIV/AIDS who are often the most
vulnerable people because they are
often sick, uninsured, marginalized
or indigent; and
Whereas, without the Ryan White
Part B funding, the ATGC will lose
at least nine full-time case management positions with an average of
10-15 years’ experience;
Whereas, the health and welfare
of some 350 clients of ATGC will be
negatively impacted as they will no
longer be able to get the compassion

and care provided by the ATGC,
which includes continuity of care in
one location, assistance in accessing
life sustaining treatment, navigating medical insurance eligibility;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council calls
upon the Ohio Department of Health
to fully restore Ryan White Part B
funding for fiscal year 2017-2018 to
the AIDS Taskforce of Greater
Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to provide copies of this
resolution
to
Richard
Hodges,
Director of the Ohio Department of
Health; Dr. Mary DiOrio, Medical
Director, the Ohio Department of
Health; Katherine Shumate, Ryan
White Part B Administrator and HIV
Care Services Section Administrator,
Ohio Department of Health; Laurie
Rickert, Administrator of Community
Based
Programs
of
the
Ohio
Department of Health; and the AIDS
Taskforce of Greater Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted April 3, 2017.
