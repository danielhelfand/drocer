that is vehicle-related, the court may
admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled
substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in
the defendant’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, urine or
other bodily substance at the time of
the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance
withdrawn within three (3) hours of
the time of the alleged violation. The
three (3) hour time limit specified in
this division regarding the admission
of evidence does not extend or affect
the two (2) hour time limit specified in

drug, controlled substance, metabolite
of
a
controlled
substance,
or
combination content of the whole
blood, blood serum or blood plasma.
This limitation does not apply to the
taking of breath or urine specimens. A
person authorized to withdraw blood
under this division may refuse to
withdraw blood under this division, if
in that person’s opinion, the physical
welfare of the person would be
endangered by the withdrawing of
blood.
The
bodily
substance
withdrawn
under
this
division
(d)(1)B.
shall
be
analyzed
in
accordance with methods approved by
the Ohio Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit
issued by the Director pursuant to RC
3701.143.
C. As used in division (d)(1)B. of
this section, “emergency medical
technician-intermediate”
and
“emergency
medical
technicianparamedic” have the same meanings
as in RC 4765.01.
(2) In a criminal prosecution for a
violation of division (a) of this section
or for an equivalent offense that is
vehicle-related, if there was at the
time the bodily substance was
withdrawn a concentration of less
than the applicable concentration of
alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this
section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a
violation of division (a)(1)J. of this
section, that fact may be considered
with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution
for a violation of division (b) of this
section.

to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the
person tested may have a physician, a
registered nurse or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of
the person’s own choosing administer
a chemical test or tests, at the person’s
expense,
in
addition
to
any
administered at the request of a law
enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division
(g)(5)
of
this
section
or
RC
4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer
shall advise the person at the time of
the arrest that the person may have an
independent chemical test taken at
the person’s own expense. If the
person was under arrest other than
described in RC 4511.191(A)(5), the
form to be read to the person to be
tested, as required under division (g)
of this section, shall state that the
person may have an independent test
performed at the person’s expense.
The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person
shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test
or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.

abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a
prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite
of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath,
or urine, if a law enforcement officer
has administered a field sobriety test
to the operator of the vehicle involved
in the violation and if it is shown by
clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in
substantial compliance with the
testing standards for any reliable,
credible and generally accepted field
sobriety tests that were in effect at the
time the tests were administered,
including but not limited to any
testing standards then in effect that
were set by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, all of
the following apply:
1.
The
officer
may
testify
concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
2. The prosecution may introduce
the results of the field sobriety test so
administered as evidence in any
proceedings
in
the
criminal
prosecution.
3. If testimony is presented or
evidence is introduced under division
(d)(4)B.1. or (d)(4)B.2. of this section
and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible
under
the
Rules
of
Evidence, the court shall admit the
testimony or evidence and the trier of
fact shall give it whatever weight the
trier
of
fact
considers
to
be
appropriate.

you refuse to take a chemical test, you
will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the
state O.V.I.
(Read this part unless the person is
under
arrest
for
solely
having
physical control of a vehicle while
under the influence.) “If you take any
chemical test required by law and are
found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in your whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath,
or urine as set by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended
immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
“If you take a chemical test, you
may have an independent chemical
test taken at your own expense.”

the best learning environment for
Cleveland’s young people; and

collective
bargaining
with their employers; and

bridges (aka “jetbridges”) from all
such unleased gates except gates C10 and C-14; and
Whereas, the Airport is using the
gates no longer leased by United,
returned to Airport control, to meet
significantly increased immediate
and anticipated demand by various
airlines for common-use gates resulting from the addition of new air carriers and of new flights by existing
air carriers at the Airport, and for
overflow gate use by United; and
Whereas, to operate gates C-10
and C-14 to provide adequate facilities to meet immediate and anticipated
airline
demand
for
fully
equipped common-use gates, the City
requires ownership and control of
the jetbridges attached to those gate
premises and currently in service;
and
Whereas, United is willing to sell
the jetbridges and necessary associated equipment at both gate C-10
and gate C-14 to the City Department of Port Control for the consideration of $130,000.00, which amount
two jetbridge maintenance and supply firms have agreed is fair market value; and
Whereas, purchase of the jetbridges currently in use at gates C10 and C-14 will maintain immediate
availability of those gates for common use and avoid the time delay
and costs of purchase and delivery
of jetbridges on the open market;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council determines that the within commodities
are non-competitive and cannot be
secured from any source other than
United Airlines, Inc. Therefore the
Director of Port Control is authorized to make one or more written

exceed $130,000.00, to be purchased
by the Commissioner of Purchases
