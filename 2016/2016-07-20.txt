Ord. No. 814-16.
By Council Member Brancatelli.
An emergency ordinance extending the moratorium on the review
and issuance of land filling permits
in the City of Cleveland unless
authorization is given by Council.
Whereas, the issuance of land filling permits is governed by Chapter
561 of the Codified Ordinances; and
Whereas, Chapter 561 authorizes
the Mayor’s Office of Capital Projects to issue permits to fill land;
however, the chapter’s very broad
criteria fails to provide community
safeguards,
limitations
on
the
amount of fill or to require inspections of the filling process or the
type of fill;
Whereas, Chapter 561 does not
require coordination with other relevant city departments, often leaving city departments unaware of

The City Record
matters a department should be
monitoring and regulating; and
Whereas, this Council believes the
filling permit process must contain
rigorous yet reasonable regulations
that will allow for better control by
the city of both the land fill permitting process and filling process
itself; and
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 11915, passed July 22, 2015, this Council declared a moratorium on the
review and issuance of land filling
permits in the City of Cleveland
until January 22, 2016; and
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 3916, passed April 4, 2016, this Council
extended the moratorium on the
review and issuance of land filling
permits in the City of Cleveland
until July 22, 2016; and
Whereas, appropriate city departments are in the process of drafting
reasonable regulations within a new
permitting procedure for filling of
land in order to create a clear and
efficient process with community
safeguards,
limitations
on
the
amount of fill and to require inspections of the filling process and the
type of fill; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health, safety, or
welfare in that an extension of the
moratorium
on
the
review
and
issuance of land fill permits in the
City is necessary to allow the continued consideration of improved
regulations for a land fill permitting
process; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, for the reasons
stated in the preamble, this Council
declares an extension of the moratorium on the review and issuance
of land filling permits for a period
commencing on July 22, 2016 and
ending on either the effective date
of an ordinance creating new regulations for the land fill permitting
process
or
January
22,
2017,
whichever date occurs first, unless
authorization for a specific permit is
given by Council via separate legislation within the moratorium period.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force

An emergency ordinance extending the moratorium on the review
and issuance of land filling permits
in the City of Cleveland unless
authorization is given by Council.
Whereas, the issuance of land filling permits is governed by Chapter
561 of the Codified Ordinances; and
Whereas, Chapter 561 authorizes
the Mayor’s Office of Capital Projects to issue permits to fill land;
however, the chapter’s very broad
criteria fails to provide community
safeguards,
limitations
on
the
amount of fill or to require inspections of the filling process or the
type of fill;
Whereas, Chapter 561 does not
require coordination with other relevant city departments, often leaving city departments unaware of
matters a department should be
monitoring and regulating; and

1117

63
Whereas, this Council believes the
filling permit process must contain
rigorous yet reasonable regulations
that will allow for better control by
the city of both the land fill permitting process and filling process
itself; and
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 11915, passed July 22, 2015, this Council declared a moratorium on the
review and issuance of land filling
permits in the City of Cleveland
until January 22, 2016; and
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 3916, passed April 4, 2016, this Council
extended the moratorium on the
review and issuance of land filling
permits in the City of Cleveland
until July 22, 2016; and
Whereas, appropriate city departments are in the process of drafting
reasonable regulations within a new
permitting procedure for filling of
land in order to create a clear and
efficient process with community
safeguards,
limitations
on
the
amount of fill and to require inspections of the filling process and the
type of fill; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health, safety, or
welfare in that an extension of the
moratorium
on
the
review
and
issuance of land fill permits in the
City is necessary to allow the continued consideration of improved
regulations for a land fill permitting
process; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, for the reasons
stated in the preamble, this Council
declares an extension of the moratorium on the review and issuance
of land filling permits for a period
commencing on July 22, 2016 and
ending on either the effective date
of an ordinance creating new regulations for the land fill permitting
process
or
January
22,
2017,
whichever date occurs first, unless
authorization for a specific permit is
given by Council via separate legislation within the moratorium period.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
