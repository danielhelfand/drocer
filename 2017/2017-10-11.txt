redevelopment of the Cleveland Athletic Club located at 1118-1148 Euclid

the Revised Code, the improvements
declared to be a public purpose may
be exempt from real property taxation; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of
the Revised Code, the owners of real
property may be required to make

Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of
the Revised Code, the exemption
may exceed 75% of the improvements for up to 30 years when a portion of the service payments in lieu
of taxes so collected are distributed
to the Cleveland Metropolitan School
District (“District”) in an amount
equal to the amount the District
would
have
received
had
the
improvements not been exempted
from taxation; and
Whereas, in compliance with Sections 5709.41(C)(4) and 5709.83 of
the Revised Code, the City notified
the District of its intent to enact
this ordinance and enter into the
agreement authorized by Section 2
of this ordinance; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore

1724

Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the improvements
(under Section 5709.41(A) of the
Revised Code) to the Real Property

Project Summary
CAC Project 2014 Limited Liability Company, or designee, (“Redeveloper”) is proposing to redevelop the

October 11, 2017
Cleveland Athletic Club located at
1118-1148 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland,
OH 44115 (“Project Site”) to include
165 units of residential space, 49
indoor parking spaces, 6,800 SF
office space and 3,990 SF first floor
retail space. CAC Project 2014 Limited Liability Company is an Ohio
limited liability company, which is
wholly-owned by Cleveland Euclid
Hotel Associates, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the “Parent”). The managers of the Parent
are principals of Great Lakes Financial Group, Precision Environmental
and Weingart Development.
The century-old, 16-story Cleveland Athletic Club has been vacant
since 2007. After a number of development blocks and hurdles, the
Redeveloper took ownership of the
building in Spring 2015 with the
intent of moving the project forward. Great Lakes Financial Group
proposes to relocate their offices to
the new office space in the Cleveland Athletic Club, with their current first floor location on Huron
Road
backfilled
with
additional
retail amenities. The Redeveloper is
targeting service-based retail, such
as a pharmacy, for the first floor
retail at the project.
The total development cost for the
project is approximately $62.8 million. The Redeveloper has incurred
significant costs to date, removing
asbestos from the property and conducting some interior demolition.
The Redeveloper has requested a
TIF to address the remaining funding gap, a result of the building’s
extended vacancy, deferred maintenance needs and the high cost of
construction. Many aesthetic features of the athletic club's original
space will stay, as the project was
awarded Historic Tax Credits as
part of the capital stack.
The property is a critical piece to
completing the redevelopment of
Euclid Avenue, stitching together
Downtown and Playhouse Square.
The redevelopment of this building
will eliminate one of the last major
development
gaps
along
Euclid
Avenue in this area. In addition, the
project will support the residential
demand
downtown
where
rental
occupancy is near record highs.
Proposed City Assistance
• This ordinance will authorize the
Director of Economic Development to enter into a 30-year nonschool Tax Increment Finance
(TIF) agreement with CAC Project 2014 Limited Liability Company and/or its designee. The
City will have declared certain
improvements with respect to the
project to be a public purpose and
exempt 100% of the improvements
from real property taxes. The project is subject to a 15-year residential tax abatement, which is
intended to have priority over the
TIF exemption. The TIF will, in
effect, be on the commercial real

The City Record
estate for the first 15 years and
will capture the full value in the
remaining 15 years.
• The Redeveloper agrees to make
certain improvements to those
parcels and make payments in
lieu of taxes (PILOTs) equal to
the taxes that would have been
paid for those parcels but for the
TIF. A portion of the PILOTs will
be paid to the Cleveland Metropolitan School District in the
amount the District would have
otherwise received but for the
TIF by the County (District payments). The Redeveloper will be
responsible for any shortfall of
PILOT payments for project costs
through a “Minimum Service Payment” requirement.
• This ordinance will authorize the

LLC, DBA Dollar General Store,
#19256, 13020 Miles Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44105, Permit Number
22348152725; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to

permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.

to
total
approximately
$94,400.00 for each term and optional renewal year; and
Whereas, the estimated total contract amount of $94,400.00 provided

Whereas, Consultant has proposed
