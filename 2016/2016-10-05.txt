City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, notwithstanding

Council, through the President of
Council, is authorized to enter into a
Memorandum of Understanding with
DigitalC to partner with DigitalC in
its technology access and inclusion

a grant application to the MacArthur
Foundation. The Memorandum of
Understanding authorized by this
ordinance shall be substantially in
the following form:

The City Record
MEMORANDUM OF
UNDERSTANDING
This Memorandum of Understanding is effective on the date last signed
below, by and between DigitalC and
the Cleveland City Council.
Whereas, the John D. & Catherine
T.
MacArthur
Foundation
(“MacArthur Foundation”) is an independent foundation established in
1978 with the goal of building a more
just, verdant and peaceful world;
Whereas, MacArthur Foundation is
seeking, through its 100&Change
competition to solve a critical societal
problem;
Whereas, DigitalC is a 501(c)(3)
tax exempt civic tech organization
that partners with the community to
design technology-driven programs
and services with a diverse team of
experts with experience in technology, start-up’s, strategy, business and
civic tech. DigitalC engages with the
business, technology and civic communities to provide strategies and
programs to enable communities to
support 21st century opportunities for
all. Founded in Cleveland, Ohio, DigitalC aspires to be a leading advocate
for the digital transformation of communities across the nation.
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
Cleveland City Council, the legislative branch of the City of Cleveland,
serves citizens by monitoring city
departments, approving budgets, and
enacting legislation to improve the
quality of life in an effective and
financially responsible way.
Whereas, DigitalC, as the project
lead, seeks to collaborate with Cleveland City Council and other community partners to create a scalable and
model
for
reducing
replicable
inequality whereby those who have
experienced structural barriers to
participating in the economy of the
21st century will be able to digitally
access
public
services,
actively
engage in their own health and wellness and drive their own education
and career opportunities (“the Project”).
Whereas, the purpose of this MOU is
to set forth the general terms surrounding the collaboration of the parties to advance the Project.
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties
agree as follows:
1. Compliance with MacArthur
Foundation
100&Change
Grant
Agreement. The parties agree to comply with all terms of the MacArthur
Foundation Grant Agreement.
2. Supervision and Responsibility.
DigitalC will have supervision of the
Project and control over the use of
grant funds. In the event the Project
is awarded funding by the MacArthur
Foundation, Cleveland City Council
will not be a sub-recipient of grant
funds due to the eligibility criteria of
the MacArthur Foundation, pursuant
to this opportunity.
3. Governance. While DigitalC is
the entity ultimately responsible for
management of the Project and the
proper administration of grant funds,
success of this Project depends upon
the engagement and support of the
citizens of Cuyahoga County, and the
valuable knowledge and perspective
of all community partners. To this
end, a Project Board of Advisors shall
be established composed of a representative from the each of the communities impacted, DigitalC, and
each community partner. The Project
Board of Advisors shall provide overall guidance for the implementation

1469

11
of the Project, including on financing,
financial or other governance issues.
Termination of the MOU is addressed
in paragraph 5 below. Termination of
the Project shall be a decision of last
resort and shall only be made by a
vote of seventy-five percent (75%) of
the voting representatives of the Project Board of Advisors following at
least a six-month period of consideration, which shall include consultation
with the MacArthur Foundation.
Other decisions that affect multiple
parties and that deal with the overall
scope and direction of the Project
shall be subject to approval by the
voting representatives of the community residents, DigitalC and a majority of the voting representatives of the
community partners.
4. Compliance with Laws. The parties will comply with all applicable
federal, state and local laws in connection with the Project.
5. Termination of MOU. The parties
are committed to supporting the Project through the duration of its conception and implementation. The parties are further committed to working
in good faith toward resolution of any
disputes arising under the Project. In
the event of a material breach of the
MOU by either party, the non-breaching party will provide the breaching
party with written notice of the
alleged breach and allow the allegedly breaching party ninety (90) days to
cure the breach to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching party.
If the allegedly breaching party fails
to cure, or fails to make substantial
steps toward cure in the reasonable
opinion of the non-breaching party
within said ninety (90) day period,
the non-breaching party may then terminate the MOU by providing the
allegedly breaching party thirty (30)
days written notice.
6. Intellectual Property. Ownership
of intellectual property shall follow
U.S. patent law. Ownership of intellectual property created solely by DigitalC will be owned by DigitalC; ownership of intellectual property created solely by the Cleveland City Council will be owned by Cleveland City
Council. Intellectual property created
jointly by DigitalC, Cleveland City
Council, and any other community
partner shall be jointly owned by the
respective creators. The parties agree
to enter into licensing agreements for
the intellectual property with the specific intent of using such intellectual
property to advance the Project. Any
revenue generated from intellectual
property used in the Project will not
result in more than incidental benefit
to any private interests.
7. Responsible Parties. The persons
or their delegates authorized, on
behalf of each party, to speak, act and
execute agreements in connection
with the Project are as follows:

measurable reduction in inequality
through the use of technology for
those in Cuyahoga County with structural barriers to participation in the
21st century economy. The parties
agree that any revenue generated by
the Project will be used to further
advance the Project. No private interests will benefit from the revenue
stream on a basis that is more than
incidental to the primary charitable
purpose to be served by the project.
9. Term and Termination. This MOU
will be in effect for the duration of the
Project.
10. Amendments. No amendment of
any term of this MOU will be effective
