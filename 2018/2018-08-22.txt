ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 888-18.
By Mayor Jackson.
An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s desire that Cleveland and Beit Shean and Valley of
Springs, Israel establish a sister city
relationship and authorizing the
Mayor to enter into such agreement
and execute such documents that
are necessary to implement the relationship.
Whereas, Beit Shean, Israel, and
Valley of Springs, which is the
regional government for the area
surrounding the City of Beit Shean

The City Record
(“Beit
Shean
and
Valley
of
Springs”), are home to approximately 29,000 people; and
Whereas, its residents came to
Israel from many different communities in Europe, North Africa and
the Middle East and like Cleveland,
is a community of immigrants; and
Whereas, in 1995, Beit Shean, Valley of Springs, and the Jewish Federation of Cleveland (the “Federation”) began its partnership and has
grown and deepened over the past
23 years; and
Whereas,
the
Federation
has
invested huge resources into its
work on community and economic
development of Beit Shean and Valley of Springs and has developed
numerous educational and cultural
exchange programs that have connected thousands of Clevelanders to
Beit Shean and Valley of Springs;
and
Whereas, over the past three
years, the Federation brought nonJewish Cleveland leaders to Beit
Shean and Valley of Springs, including civic leaders and community
development professionals, who are
engaged in the Federation’s work in
the St. Clair-Superior neighborhood;
and
Whereas, these exchanges are
already yielding specific results in
the areas of youth engagement for
a program that is in development at
the Cleveland Public Library modeled after a Beit Shean teen engagement program, cultural programs
with the possible development of a
program to connect African-American youth with elderly leaders in
the Civil Rights movement and modeled after an existing program that
connects young Jewish adults with
Holocaust
survivors,
and
more,
including additional possibilities for
business-to-business cooperation and
knowledge sharing; and
Whereas, in addition to Clevelanders traveling to Beit Shean, residents of Beit Shean also visit Cleveland annually; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that peace in the world
can only be assured thrugh a
strengthening
of
relationships
among the world’s people; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council, desiring that the City of Cleveland and
Beit Shean and Valley of Springs,
Israel, establish a sister city relationship, authorize the Mayor to
enter into such agreements and execute such documents that are necessary to implement the sister city
relationship on such terms and conditions as the Director of Law determines are in the best interest of the
general public.
Section 2. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good

and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation

Project Summary and Discussion
Alto JHB Acquisition, LLC or
designee, (“Developer”) is proposing
a mixed use redevelopment located
at 1001-1101 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44115 (“Project Site”). In
order to assist with the project
financing,
the
Developer
has
requested the City impose a 5709.41,
30-Year, Non-School TIF. The TIF
will support debt service related to
the project and assist with the redevelopment
of
approximately
228
market rate apartments, over 18,700
square feet of commercial space,
and parking for residents. The project will create and/or cause to create 30 new full-time jobs at the Project Site with an approximate payroll of $807,000.
Alto JHB Acquisition, LLC is an
entity of Alto Partners. Alto Partners is a global real estate development company and has completed
five projects in the U.S. totaling $200
million. As the CEO of U.S. Operations of Alto Partners, Michael
Sabracos has extensive business and
real estate development experience.
He has managed the acquisition,
redevelopment,
management,
and
sales of over 20 million square feet
of real estate. Alto Partners’ newest
project is the John Hartness Brown
(JHB) Building, which they purchased in August of 2017.
The JHB Building was constructed between 1914 and 1920, and sat
vacant for over a decade. Alto JHB
Acquisition, LLC plans to redevelop
the vacant property into the “Euclid
Grand”, rebranding the property.
The additional housing with this
project will provide a much needed
supply to an area that is in high
demand for people to live downtownwhere occupancy is nearly 94.5 percent. The total project investment is
expected to exceed $78 million.
Proposed City Assistance
• This ordinance will authorize the
Director of Economic Development to enter into a 30-year nonschool Tax Increment Finance
(TIF) agreement with Alto JHB
Acquisition,
LLC
and/or
its
designee. The City will have
declared
certain
improvements
with respect to the project to be
a public purpose and exempt
100% of the improvements from
real property taxes.
• The Developer agrees to make
certain improvements to the parcel and make payments in lieu of
taxes (PILOTs) equal to the
taxes that would have been paid
for the parcel but for the TIF. A
portion of the PILOTs will be
paid to the Cleveland Metropolitan School District in the amount
the District would have otherwise
received but for the TIF by the
County
(“District
Payments”).
The balance of the PILOTS will
be utilized to fund eligible project
costs and project debt. The developer will be responsible for any
shortfall of PILOT payments for
project costs.
• The TIF will be immediately
effective on the residential and
new parking garage after the
expiration of the 15-year tax
abatement for new residential
construction.
