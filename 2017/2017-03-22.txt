CIVILIAN POLICE
REVIEW BOARD

OPERATING MANUAL
AND PROCEDURES
LAST AMENDED:
FEBRUARY 1, 2017
A. Purpose of the Police Review
Board
1. The purpose of these procedures
is to facilitate the operation of the
Civilian
Police
Review
Board
(“CPRB”), including the review of
public
complaints
filed
against
sworn police officers and non-sworn
employees who are employed by the
Cleveland Division of Police as
authorized by the City of Cleveland
Charter (§§ 115-3, 115-4).
2. In order for this purpose to be
achieved, the Civilian Police Review
Board, hereafter referred to as the
Board or the CPRB, shall have the
power to receive, cause investigation of, and recommend, and in some
cases determine, the resolution of
public complaints regarding misconduct allegedly committed by employees of the Cleveland Division of
Police (“CDP”).
B. Purpose, Scope, and Force of
this Operating Manual
1. In addition to the Cleveland
Charter, this Operating Manual contains all of the rules, procedures,
processes, and general operations of
the CPRB. If rules, procedures,
processes, or operations codified
elsewhere or functionally operational elsewhere and potentially,
apparently, and/or actually conflict
with the provisions of this Manual,
the provisions of this Manual control.
2. All provisions of this Operating
Manual must be considered in a
manner consistent with the Charter
of the City of Cleveland.
C. Duties and Responsibilities of
the Board, Its Members, and Staff
1. The Board, Board members, and
all Board staff must acquit themselves of the duties outlined here in
a manner that is consistent with the
following
statement
of
ethics
(adopted from the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law

The City Record
Enforcement (“NACOLE”) Code of
Ethics). (See Attachment A.)
a. Members of the CPRB have a
unique role as public servants overseeing the conduct of law enforcement officers. The community, government, and law enforcement have
entrusted members of the CPRB to
conduct their work in a professional, fair and impartial manner. This
trust is earned through a firm commitment to the public good, the mission of the CPRB, and to the ethical
and
professional
standards
described herein.
b. These standards are intended to
be of general application. The spirit of these ethical and professional
standards should guide CPRB members and staff in adapting to individual circumstances, and in promoting public trust, integrity and
transparency.
c. Personal Integrity: CPRB members and staff will demonstrate the
highest
standards
of
personal
integrity, commitment, truthfulness,
and fortitude in order to inspire
trust among CPRB stakeholders,
and to set an example for others.
d. Avoid conflicts of interest:
CPRB members and staff are expected to conduct themselves in a fair
and impartial manner and recuse
themselves when significant conflicts of interest arise. CPRB members and staff will not accept gifts,
gratuities or favors that could compromise their impartiality and independence or that have a substantial
and improper influence upon the
performance of their duties. As public officials, CPRB members are
bound by the City and State ethics
laws.
e.
Independent
and
Thorough
Oversight: CPRB members and staff
are expected to conduct all evaluations and reviews with diligence, an
open and questioning mind, integrity, objectivity and fairness, and in
a timely manner. CPRB members
and staff are expected to rigorously
test the accuracy and reliability of
information from all sources and
consider and present facts and findings without regard to personal
beliefs or concern for personal, professional or political consequences.
f. Transparency and Confidentiality: CPRB members and staff are

all issues presented in the Hearing
checklist, and (2) upon motion by
the Chair or another Board Member.
h. Upon completion of deliberation
of one case, the Board shall consider,
in
the
manner
outlined
in
5(a)–(e) above, all other cases on
the meeting’s agenda.

6. Adjudication of Cases
a. After consideration of all cases
identified prior to the meeting on
the meeting Agenda, the Board shall
move into the voting process. The
Board shall move from the Executive Session back into a regular,
public session only (1) upon completion of consideration of all issues
presented in the Hearing Checklist
for all cases on the meeting’s agenda, and (2) upon motion by the
Chair or another Board Member.
b. Categories of Dispositions
i. The Board shall vote on a recommendation of one of the following findings for each allegation:
1. Sustained: Preponderance of the
evidence supports a finding that the
alleged conduct occurred and the
officer’s actions were inconsistent
with law or CDP policy, procedure,
or training. A complaint may be
“sustained in part” if the investigation revealed sufficient evidence to
support a finding of a policy violation on one or more, but not all of
the complainant’s allegations. A
complaint may also be “sustained
for a violation not based on original
complaint”
if
the
investigation
reveals evidence of misconduct that
was
not
included
in
the
complainant’s original allegation but
arose out of the incident that is the
subject of the complaint.
2. Exonerated: Preponderance of
the evidence supports a finding that
the alleged conduct occurred but the
officer’s actions were consistent
with law or CDP policy, procedure
or training.
3. Unfounded: Preponderance of
the evidence supports a finding that
the alleged conduct did not occur.
4. Insufficient Evidence: Preponderance of the evidence fails to
establish whether or not the conduct
occurred.
c. Standard for Disposition:
i. The Board shall apply the “preponderance of evidence” standard of
proof, set forth in Section (I)(2), to
each and all of the allegations identified in the investigative file.
d. Voting
i. Disposition votes shall be public.
ii. Decisions of the Board shall be
made by majority vote.
iii. In the event of a tie vote, the
CPRB will return to executive session to deliberate further. If a
majority vote cannot be achieved,
the Board will recess the case until
its next meeting and deliberate
anew.
7. Recommendations Regarding
Discipline or Other Remedial Action
a. Where the Board reaches an
adjudication of “Sustained” on one or
more allegations, the Board will
return to Executive Session to
deliberate on a recommendation

32
regarding appropriate discipline or
other remedial action.
b. Potential discipline and other
remedial actions include re-training,
a letter of reinstruction, counseling
from a supervisor, suspension, demotion, termination, or other action
that may be appropriate to address
the violation.
c. To determine the recommended
discipline action, the Board shall
refer to the relevant Disciplinary
GPO and/or other relevant General
Police Orders addressing discipline,
re-training, supervisory intervention,
or other remedial action for misconduct or deficient performance. The
Board shall make recommendations
consistent with, and not materially
deviating from, the Discipline GPO
and/or other relevant General Police
Orders.
d. To ensure that there is just
cause for each recommendation of
discipline or other remedial action,
the Board shall consider each factor
listed on the “Just Cause Checklist”
(Attachment D), and shall document
this by completing the checklist.
e. On an interim basis, the Board
will recommend the disciplinary
group of the disciplinary matrix to
be used by the Chief of Police or the
Director of Public Safety. In cases
where an officer would be eligible
for suspension without pay, the
Board will not make a recommendation as to the specific number of
days suspension to be served.
f. The Board shall conclude the
deliberation regarding discipline or
other remedial action only (1) upon
completion of consideration of all
issues presented in the Just Cause
Checklist, and (2) upon motion by
the Chair or another Board Member.
g. Upon completion of deliberation
of one case, the Board shall consider,
in
the
manner
outlined
in
7(a)–(f) above, all other cases on
the meeting’s agenda.
h. Once the Board has arrived at
a recommendation regarding discipline or other remedial action, it
shall return to public session to vote
on a recommendation.
i. Voting
i. Disposition votes regarding discipline shall be public.
ii. Decisions of the Board regarding recommendations on discipline
or other remedial action shall be
made by majority vote. In the event
a majority of the Board cannot
agree on a particular level of discipline, the Board Secretary will prepare an explanation of the votes
cast by each Board member for the
Board’s final summary.

8.
Recommendation
Regarding
Training/Policy Changes
a. In addition to recommending
discipline or other remedial action
for CDP officers and employees, the
Board shall also consider whether a
complaint suggests that CDP should
revise its policies, strategies, tactics,
or training.
b. If so, its Final Summary shall
so indicate.
9.
Recommendation
Regarding
Commendations
a. During review and consideration
of investigations, Board members may

The City Record
identify
officer
or
employee
performance that is commendable,
superior, noteworthy, or otherwise
deserving of special and positive
recognition. In such circumstances, a
Board member may move that the
Board issue a commendation.
b. If a majority of the Board votes
to approve the motion, the Board’s
Chair will provide a written commendation of the identified officer
or employee’s performance to the
Chief of Police and Director of Public Safety.

10. Final Summary
a. The Board shall prepare a Final
Summary with respect to each case
or matter under consideration.
b.
The
Final
Summary
shall
include the Board’s disposition and,
where applicable, recommended discipline or other remedial action, and
a brief outline of the evidence that
the Board concluded tended to support the disposition and/or recommendation. If the Board’s recommended disposition departs from
OPS’s recommended disposition, the
Final Summary shall also include a
written justification for the departure. The Summary may also include
a recommendation that the incident
suggests that CDP should revise its
policies, strategies, tactics, or training.
c. The Board shall follow the
Final Summary Checklist (Attachment E).
J. Special Procedures for Administrative Dismissal

1. Assignment of Cases
a. On an interim basis, cases in
which OPS has initiated a disposition of “Administrative Dismissal”
shall be reviewed by the Board upon
a
timely
request
for
review
(“appeal”) by a complainant. In
order to facilitate this process, OPS
shall include in every disposition
letter where a complaint has been
administratively dismissed, notice to
the complainant of their right to
request a review by the Board within 15 days of the date of receipt of
the OPS notice.
b. For each appeal, a three-member panel shall be chosen by the
Chair in accord with Section H.2. of
this Manual. Each panel member
shall review the Administrative Dismissal
Form
prepared
by
OPS
(Attachment
F),
to
determine
whether the undisputed facts support the ground(s) for administrative dismissal.
c. If the Panel members unanimously determine that the undisputed facts support the ground(s)
for administrative dismissal, the
Panel Chair shall check the box on
the Administrative Dismissal Form
stating that they concur with OPS’s
recommendation, sign and date the
form, and return it to OPS. OPS will
then notify the complainant of the
completion of the Board’s review.
d. If any Panel member determines that the undisputed facts do
not support the grounds for administrative dismissal, or that the case

400

March 22, 2017
requires further investigation, the
appeal will be referred to the entire
Board for a hearing and decision at
its next meeting. If the Board, by a
majority vote, determines that the
undisputed facts do not support the
grounds
for
administrative
dismissal, or that the case requires further investigation, the case will be
returned to OPS for investigation.
e. During the pendency of the Consent Decree between the United
States
and
City
of
Cleveland
addressing the performance of the
Cleveland Division of Police, ongoing reviews and audits of the
Administrative
Dismissal
process
will be conducted by the Monitoring
Team to ensure compliance with
OPS
policies
and
the
Consent
Decree.

2. Eligibility for Administrative
Dismissal
i. Only the following types of complaints may be Administratively Dismissed:
a. Complaints disputing traffic
citations, except that allegations of
misconduct contained in such complaints (e.g., racial profiling, illegal
search, excessive force) will be classified and investigated according to
their merits;
b. Complaints alleging a delay in
police services where the preliminary
investigation
demonstrates
that the delay was due to workload,
or was otherwise unavoidable;
c. Complaints regarding off-duty
conduct, unless the employee is
working secondary employment, or
the alleged conduct, or its effects,
are inconsistent with law or CDP
policy, procedure, or training or
have a substantial nexus to the officer's City employment; and
d. Complaints in which the preliminary investigation demonstrates
that the officer was not an employee of CDP at the time the conduct
occurred, or where the identity of
the employee cannot be determined
despite the best efforts of OPS.
ii. Complaints that allege other
types of conduct cannot be disposed
of via the Administrative Dismissal
process.
K. Post-Hearing Procedures

1. Notice to Complainant and Subject CDP Employee
a. Upon completion of every hearing, the Board shall cause OPS to
notify the complainant and each
subject CDP employee. The notice
shall contain written notice that the
complaint was considered by the
Board and the date of that hearing;
and an explanation of the process
utilized by the Board.
b. The notice shall include:
i. The date, time and location of
the hearing.
ii. The nature of the Board’s conclusions and recommendations
iii. An explanation of the evidence
that both tended to support and
tended not to support the conclusion.
iv. Information on whether there
will be further proceedings related
to the complaint, such as referral of

March 22, 2017
the matter to the Chief of Police or
Safety Director for a hearing and
possible imposition of discipline
c. OPS shall use best efforts to
contact the complainant and subject
employees, including:
i. Sending a letter via United
States Postal Service to the last
known address of the complainant;
ii. Providing written notice to the
subject employees through the subject officers’ command staff or the
subject employee’s supervisor; and
iii. Electronic mail to the parties,
when feasible.
d. OPS shall make record of
notices sent and keep the Board
advised of its actions in that regard.

2. Forwarding of Recommendation
to Chief of Police
a. Upon completion of a hearing,
the CPRB shall deliver its Final
Summary prepared for each complaint adjudicated as “Sustained” to
the Chief of Police and/or the Director of Public Safety, as appropriate,
within fourteen calendar days.
b. The Chief or Director of Public
Safety shall hold a due process hearing, as required by law, at which
involved officers may present testimony or other evidence.
L. Action Following Hearing by
the Chief/Safety Director

1. Notice to the CPRB of Hearing
Outcome
a. Within 10 days of the conclusion of a hearing, the Chief or Director of Public Safety will notify the
Board of the outcome, including the
disposition of the charges and any
discipline imposed.
b. If the disposition or discipline
departs from the Board’s recommendation, the Chief or Director of Public Safety will provide a written
explanation for this departure.
2. Overriding Departure by the
Chief of Police
a. In cases involving Board recommended discipline of a suspension of 10 working days or less,
where the Chief of Police departs
from the Board’s disposition or recommendation regarding discipline
or other outcome, the Board will
consider whether to override the
departure pursuant to the City Charter (sections 115-1 through 115-4).
b. The Chair of the Board will present the Chief’s decision at the first
CPRB meeting following receipt of
the written explanation for the
departure. If any member of the
Board believes that, notwithstanding the Chief’s determination, a preponderance of the evidence establishes misconduct, and that there is
just cause for the Board’s original
recommendation
regarding
discipline or other remedial consequence,
including suspension, demotion or
termination, then the Board member
shall move the Chair for reconsideration of the matter by the full
Board.
d. The Board shall consider and
discuss the motion for reconsideration
in
Executive
Session.
The

The City Record
Board shall conclude the deliberation of the motion for reconsideration upon motion by the Chair or
another Board Member.
e. A case shall be reconsidered,
and the discipline determination
reviewed, if and only if a majority
of the Board’s permanent members
votes to re-consider the case.
f. At the reconsideration of the
case before the Board, the procedures, processes, and standards for
governing the Board’s initial review
of the case govern, with the exception that Board members must consider (i) whether the evidence and
explanation for departure tends to
support or tends to not support the
Chief of Police’s determination, and
(ii) whether there is still just cause
to make a finding and/or impose
discipline in light of the explanation
for the departure. CPRB members
must closely review and consider
the disciplinary letter and other
materials provided to it by the
Chief, to include the content of any
evidence presented at the Chief’s
Hearing with the subject employee.
g. For the Board to impose its
original finding on any allegation
where the Chief has determined not
to do so, a majority of the Board’s
permanent members must vote that
a preponderance of evidence supports the original recommendation.
h. For the Board to impose its
original recommendation of discipline or other remedial action where
the Chief has determined not to do
so or where the Chief has determined to impose a different term of
suspension, two-thirds of the Board’s
permanent members must vote that
there is just cause to impose its
original recommendation regarding
suspension and/or the term of suspension.
i. If the Board votes to impose its
original adjudication and/or recommendation regarding discipline or
other remedial action, the Board
shall prepare an Amended Final
Summary explaining its rationale.
The Board’s Administrative Coordinator will send the Amended Final
Summary to the Director of Public
Safety with a copy to the Chief. The
Amended Final Summary will constitute a formal certification in writing of the Board’s determination, to
the Chief of Police and the Director
of Public Safety.
j. The Director of Public Safety is
the ultimate adjudicator of discipline for CDP. If the Director does
not accept the decision of the CPRB,
s/he will provide a written explanation for this decision to the Chair.

3. Notice to Complainant and Subject CDP Employee
i. Within ten days of receiving
notice that the Chief or Director of
Public Safety has determined to
impose the Board’s adjudication and
recommended discipline, the CPRB
shall cause OPS to notify the complainant
and
the
subject
CDP
employee(s).
ii. When the Chief or the Director
of Public Safety has determined to
depart from the Board’s adjudication

401

33
and/or recommended discipline, and
the Board does not reconsider this
determination, the Board shall cause
OPS to notify the complainant and
the subject CDP employee(s) no
later than ten days following its
next regular meeting. This notice
shall include the Board’s reasoning
for not reconsidering the Chief’s
determination.
iii. When the Chief has determined to depart from the Board’s
adjudication and/or recommended
discipline, and the Board reconsiders this determination, the Board
shall cause OPS to notify the complainant and the subject employee(s) of the outcome within ten
days following the meeting at which
reconsideration took place.
iv. In all cases adjudicated by the
Board, the Board will direct OPS to
provide a timely written explanation
to the complainant and the subject
employee(s) outlining the reasoning
behind the Board’s decision to issue
findings of “insufficient evidence,”
“unfounded” or “exonerated.”
M. Amendment to Operating Manual, Procedures, and Rules
1. The rules contained within this
Operating Manual, and the procedures and rules outlined here, may
only be modified, revised, amended,
