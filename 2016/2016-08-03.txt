Commission,
requirements
as
to

fitness of applicants, the Commission shall prescribe minimum experience or educational requirements
or both for entrance to examinations. Provided however that no person shall be permitted to take an
examination who is unable to produce a certificate attesting to his or
her having graduated from a standard four-year high school, except
that applicant achieving a certification of satisfactory completion of
the General Education Development
Test (GED) may be permitted to
take an examination without regard
to the certificate of graduation from
a standard four-year high school.
4.20-A Written Examinations
A written examination may be

part of the following: An objective
type examination designed to test
the
applicant’s
familiarity
with
information
and
material
which
could reasonably be expected of

the papers have been graded. The
blank envelopes of the examinees

of the examination papers have

1154

been graded. The Commission may
require
for
any
examination
a
thumb print and/or signature on
either or both the examination form
and the answer sheet; such thumb
print and/or signature shall be the
same thumb print and/or signature
as may be required and contained
on the application form.
4.301-A
Written
Examination
(computerized)
Computerized examinations may
be available to applicants on one or
more dates and times within the
testing period which shall be stated
in the testing announcement. Tests
may be conducted and managed by
consultants or special examiners
designated by the Commission and
subject to any requirements by the
Commission including, but not limited to, requirements relating to verification of the identity of applicants and tests security.
6.10 Notice of Vacancy
Before any position in the classified service shall be filled, the
appointing authority shall make a
written request of the Commission
for the certification of the names of
eligibles for such position and shall
state whether the employment is to
be permanent or temporary, and if
temporary, the duration and conditions of employment. Upon receipt of
such request, the Commission shall
certify to the appointing authority
the names and addresses of the ten
(10) persons standing highest on the
eligible list.
This section does not supersede
any collective bargaining agreements.
If there is more than one position
to be filled, the number of names to
be certified shall be determined by
taking the next higher multiple of
four above the number of vacancies,
dividing it by two and adding the
quotient to the number of vacancies
except where the number of vacancies is itself a multiple of four (4)
in which case the number of vacancies is divided by two (2) and the
quotient added to the number of
vacancies.
Nothing herein contained shall be
so construed to prevent the Commission from certifying a larger
number of eligibles if, in the opinion of the Commission, such action
would be in the best interest of the
service. However, when there is no
eligible list for the exact position to
be filled the Commission may certify eligibles from the eligible list
most nearly appropriate to the position to be filled.
6.20 Certification of Eligibles
No person shall be certified from
an eligible list more than four (4)
times to the same appointing authority for a classification, except at the
request of the appointing authority
provided, however, that no such person shall be certified when to do so
operates to prejudice the rights of
other eligibles ranking higher on
the eligible list.
Whenever one or more eligibles
that have been certified waive certification or fail to respond to notice
of certification, the certification on
which their names appear shall be
supplemented by an equal number
of additional names. No request for
certification of eligibles or additional names to supplement existing

August 3, 2016
certifications shall be honored by
the Commission after the expiration
of such eligible list.
6.50 Character of Appointments
In accordance with Section 128,
131, 131-1 and 133 of the Charter, all
appointments to positions in the
classified service of the City of
Cleveland shall be deemed to be
either regular or temporary in character. Regular appointments shall
be any appointment made from an
eligible list created as a result of an
open competitive or non-competitive
test or as a result of examination
for labor class position. An appointment shall be deemed to be a promotional when made from any promotional eligible list and involving
advancement in rank or an increase
in salary, or both.
appointments
shall
Temporary
include appointments occasioned by
emergencies and limited to thirty
(30) calendar days and appointments
for
transitory
work
not
exceeding ninety (90) calendar days
and
not
renewable.
Temporary
appointments shall include appointments made without test, in the
absence of an eligible list, appointments occasioned by emergencies
and limited to thirty (30) calendar
days and appointments for transitory work not exceeding ninety (90)
calendar days and not renewable.
6.70 Temporary Appointments
In all temporary appointments
and notices to the Commission thereof, such appointing authority shall
carefully designate which of the
three following classes of temporary
appointments is being made and the
nature of the work to be performed
thereunder:
A. Pending Establishment of Eligible List:
In the absence of an appropriate
eligible list, any place in the classified service may be filled temporarily, without test, but no such
temporary appointment shall continue after the establishment of a suitable eligible list, provided, however
that the Commission reserves the
right to review the qualifications of
any such temporary appointee if
he/she is found lacking in qualifications.
B. Transitory:
With the consent of the Commission, persons may be temporarily
employed for transitory work whenever
an
appointing
authority
requires
temporary
assistance
because of a special project or temporary increase in the work load,
due to seasonal requirements or otherwise. In making such transitory
appointments,
the
appointing
authority shall first employ persons,
in
the
appropriate
classification
based on seniority, who are then on
layoff in that classification, or if no
layoff list exists, then from an
appropriate existing eligible list for
such classification, before employing a person not on layoff or an
existing eligible list, but no such
employment shall continue for more
than ninety (90) calendar days or be
renewed.
C. Emergency:
When an emergency arises, such
that in order to prevent the loss of

The City Record

public property, serious inconvenience to the public, or damaging
delay to the public service, and one
or more persons must be employed
without the delay incident to regular certification and appointment, an
appointing authority may, without
consulting the Commission, appoint
a qualified person or persons during
the period of emergency but in no
case for a period exceeding thirty
calendar
days.
Emergency
(30)
with
the
reasons
appointments
therefore,
shall
be
immediately
reported to the Commission which
reserves the right to inquire into the
nature of the emergency and to
reject such appointments if it is
found not to be an emergency and
in no case shall successive appointments follow directly upon one
another
without
the
express
approval of the Commission.
6.80 Probationary Period
The probationary period provided
by Section 131 of the Charter of the
City of Cleveland is hereby fixed at
one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days from the effective date
of regular appointment, provided:
A. That the Commission may,
where the good of the service
requires, fix the duration of the probationary period for individual classifications
at
six
(6)
calendar
months, but such action must be
taken at the time the examination
for such classification is announced.
B. That where there is a variance
between the effective date of regular appointment and subsequent “On
Payroll Date” notice, the later date
will prevail and take precedence
over the former, the necessary calendar days of probation shall begin
from the “On Payroll Date” notice.
C. Employees will be continuously evaluated and subject to probationary termination at any time if
their performance does not merit
continued employment.
D. If retained after the one hundred and twenty (120) day probationary period, all employees, including both regular and temporary,
shall be discharged only for cause,
or subject to layoff in accordance
with Civil Service Rules. Only one
probationary period shall be served
for an employee’s current classification unless the employee is transferred or appointed to another division or governmental unit.
E. Notwithstanding the provisions
of Rule 6.80-D the Commission may,
for good cause shown, extend an
