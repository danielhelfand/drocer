ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
REPRINT
Ord. No. 654-18.
By Council Members Johnson and
Kelley (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Capital Projects
to employ one or more professional
consultants to provide various architectural, engineering, testing, and
related services needed for various
capital improvement projects, for a
period of up two years with two
options to renew for additional oneyear periods, the first option shall
require
additional
legislative
authority to exercise.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, provided this
Council passes Ordinance No. 507-18
and the City sells the bonds authorized by that ordinance, the Director of Capital Projects is authorized
to employ by contract or contracts
one or more consultants or one or
more firms of consultants for the
purpose of supplementing the regularly employed staff of the several

9
departments of the City of Cleveland
in order to provide professional services necessary to provide various
architectural, engineering, testing,
and related services needed for various capital improvement projects,
for a period of up two years with
two options to renew for additional
one-year periods. The first of the
one-year options to renew may not
be exercised without additional legislative authority. If such additional legislative authority is granted
and the first of the one-year options
to renew is exercised, then the second of the one-year options to renew
may be exercised at the option of
the Director of Capital Projects,
without the necessity of obtaining
additional authority of this Council.
The selection of the consultant or
consultants for the services shall be
made by the Board of Control on the
nomination of the Director of Capital Projects from a list of qualified
consultants available for employment as may be determined after a
full and complete canvass by the
Director of Capital Projects for the
purpose of compiling a list. The
compensation to be paid for the services shall be fixed by the Board of
Control. The contract or contracts
authorized shall be prepared by the
Director of Law, approved by the
Director of Capital Projects, and certified by the Director of Finance.
Section 2. That the cost of any
expenditure authorized by this ordinance shall be paid from the fund
or funds which are credited the proceeds of the sale of bonds authorized by Ordinance No. 507-18 if the
Council passes that ordinance and
the City sells the bonds authorized
by that ordinance and Fund Nos. 20
SF 566, 20 SF 573, 20 SF 578, and any
other funds deemed appropriate by
the Director of Finance. (RQS 0103,
RLA 2018-20)
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Passed June 4, 2018.
Effective June 5, 2018.
