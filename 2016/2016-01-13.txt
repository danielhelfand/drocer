deliver the Master Trust Agreement,
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, not inconsistent with this General Bond Ordinance and not substantially adverse
to the City, as may be approved by the
officers signing the same on behalf of
the City. The determination by those

Section 3. Terms of Bonds; Pledge
of and Lien on Net Revenues.
(a) The Bonds of each Series shall
be designated “Water Pollution Control Revenue Bonds” and contain an
appropriate Series designation. The
Bonds of each Series shall be payable
as to principal, redemption premium,

The City Record
if any, and interest, unless otherwise
provided in or pursuant to the Supplemental Bond Ordinance with respect
to a Series of Bonds, in lawful money
of the United States of America, shall
be in fully registered form (unless a
Supplemental Trust Agreement shall
have been executed and delivered
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(vi) of the
Master Trust Agreement), shall be
negotiable instruments in accordance
with the Ohio Revised Code, and shall
expressly set forth the purpose or purposes for which the Series of Bonds is
issued and such other statements or
legends as may be required by law. As
applied to any Bond that is a Capital
Appreciation Bond, any provision of
the Trust Agreement specifying the
permitted denomination of such Bond
shall refer to the Appreciated Principal Amount thereof at its stated maturity.
(b) Unless otherwise provided in
the applicable Supplemental Bond
Ordinance or Supplemental Trust
Agreement, the Bonds of each Series
shall originally be issued solely in
Book-Entry Form to a Depository to
be held in a Book-Entry System and:
(i) the Bonds shall be registered in
the name of the Depository or its nominee, as Bondholder, and immobilized
in the custody of the Depository; (ii)
there shall, unless otherwise requested by the Depository, be a single Bond
representing each interest rate for
each maturity and Sinking Fund
Installment of the Bonds; and (iii) the
Bonds shall not be transferable or
exchangeable, except for transfer to
another Depository or another nominee of a Depository, without further
action by the City as set forth in the
next succeeding paragraph of this
Section.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Bonds held in a Book-Entry System,
the City may attempt to have established a securities depository/book
entry system relationship with another Depository hereunder. If the City
does not or is unable to do so, the City
and the Trustee, after the Trustee has
made provision for notification of the
owners of book entry interests by
appropriate notice to the then Depository, shall permit withdrawal of the
Bonds from the Depository and shall
authenticate and deliver Bond certificates in fully registered form to the
assignees of the Depository or its
nominee. If the event is not the result
of City action or inaction, such withdrawal, authentication and delivery
shall be at the cost and expense
(including costs of printing or otherwise preparing, and delivering, such
replacement Bonds), of those persons
requesting such authentication and
delivery.
(c) Unless otherwise provided in
the applicable Supplemental Bond
Ordinance or Supplemental Trust
Agreement, the Bonds of each Series
shall be executed by the Mayor and
Director of Finance and approved as
to form by the Director of Law, each
of which signatures may be facsimiles. If any officer whose signature or
a facsimile thereof shall appear on
any Bonds shall cease to be such officer prior to the issuance, authentication or delivery of such Bonds, such
signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for
all purposes, the same as if such officer had remained in office until that

23

17
time. The Bonds of each Series shall
bear the corporate seal of the City or a
facsimile thereof.
(d) Unless otherwise provided in
any Supplemental Bond Ordinance,
notice of the call for redemption of
any of the Bonds, which notice (i)
shall specify the complete official
name of the Bonds to be redeemed,
including Series, CUSIP numbers (if
applicable), bond certificate numbers, the redemption date, the redemption price, and the place or places
where amounts due upon such
redemption will be payable (which
shall be the designated corporate
trust office of the Trustee or any Paying Agent) and, if less than all of the
Bonds are to be redeemed, the numbers of the Bonds and the portions of
Bonds, so to be redeemed, (ii) shall
state any condition to such redemption, (iii) shall state that on the
redemption date, and upon the satisfaction of any such condition, the
Bonds or portions thereof to be
redeemed shall cease to bear interest,
and (iv) may set forth any additional
information relating to such redemption, shall be given at least thirty (30)
days but not more than sixty (60)
days prior to the date fixed for
redemption by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class mail
to the Holder of each Bond to be
redeemed in whole or in part at the
Holder’s address shown on the Register on the fifteenth (15th) day preceding that mailing; provided, however,
that failure to give such notice by
mailing or any defect in such notice
with respect to any Bond shall not
affect the validity of any redemption
proceedings with respect to any other
Bond.
(e) The principal of and any
redemption premium on any Bond and
the Appreciated Principal Amount of
any Capital Appreciation Bond shall
be payable when due, without deduction for services of the Paying Agent,
upon presentation and surrender of
such Bond at the designated corporate trust office of the Trustee or, at
the option of the Holder, at the office,
designated by the Trustee, of any
Paying Agent, or, upon the written
request of the holder of at least
$1,000,000 in aggregate principal
amount of Bonds of a single Series,
which written request is delivered to
the Trustee at least ten (10) days
prior to the date of payment, by wire
transfer in immediately available
funds to an account in the continental
United States of America specified in
the written request by the Bondholder, but only upon presentation and
surrender to the Trustee of the Bonds
being paid.
Payment of the interest on any
Bond (except any Capital Appreciation Bond) shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft
that the Trustee shall cause to be
mailed on that date to the Person in
whose name the Bond (or one or more
Predecessor Bonds) is registered at
the close of business on the Regular
Record Date applicable to that Interest Payment Date on the Register at
the address appearing therein, or,
upon the written request of the holder
of at least $1,000,000 in aggregate
principal amount of Bonds, which
written request is delivered to the
Trustee before the applicable Regular Record Date, by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to an
account in the continental United

18
States of America specified in those
written request by such Bondholder.
If and to the extent, however, that
the City shall fail to make payment or
provision for payment of interest on
any Bond on any Interest Payment
Date, that interest shall cease to be
payable to the Person who was the
Holder of that Bond (or of one or more
Predecessor Bonds) as of the applicable Regular Record Date for such
interest payment by virtue of such
holder’s having been such on such
Regular Record Date, and such
Defaulted Interest shall be payable
by the Trustee to the person in whose
name such Bond or any Successor
Bond is registered at the close of business on the Special Record Date for
the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. Upon the receipt of
any moneys to be applied to the payment of Defaulted Interest in accordance with the provisions of Section
6.07 of the Master Trust Agreement,
the Trustee shall fix the Special
Record Date for the payment of such
Defaulted Interest, which shall be not
more than fifteen (15) nor less than
ten (10) days prior to the date of the
proposed payment and not less than
ten (10) days after the Trustee’s
receipt of such moneys. The Trustee
shall promptly notify the City of such
Special Record Date and, in the name
and at the expense of the City, shall
cause notice of the proposed payment
of such Defaulted Interest and the
Special Record Date therefor to be
mailed, first class postage prepaid, to
each Bondholder at his address as it
appears on the Register not less than
ten (10) days prior to such Special
Record Date, but such mailing shall
not be a condition precedent to such
payment, and any failure so to mail
any such notice shall not affect the
validity of the proceedings for the
payment of such Defaulted Interest.
Such Defaulted Interest shall be paid
by check or draft mailed by the
Trustee to the person in whose name
that Bond or any Successor Bond is
registered on the registration books
at the close of business on the Special
Record Date or, upon the written
request of the holder of at least
$1,000,000 in aggregate principal
amount of Bonds, which written
request is delivered, to the Trustee
before the applicable Special Record
Date, by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to an account in the
continental United States of America
specified in those written request by
such Bondholder. In the event any
Defaulted Interest on any Bond
insured or secured by a municipal
bond insurance policy or a bank line
or letter of credit is paid by the Credit
Provider of such policy or of such line
or letter of credit, and if as a result of
such payment such Credit Provider
becomes the assignee of the right of
the holder of such Bond to such
Defaulted Interest, then the provisions of this subsection (e) may be
superseded by any contrary provisions of the applicable Supplemental
Trust Agreement requiring or permitting such Defaulted Interest to be
paid by the Trustee directly to such
Credit
Provider,
irrespective
of
whether such Credit Provider is the
registered owner of such Bond on the
Special Record Date for the payment
of such Defaulted Interest.
Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this subsection (e), else-

The City Record
where in the Trust Agreement, or in
the Bonds, the Trustee, with the
approval of the City, may enter into
an agreement with the holder of any
Bond providing for making all payments to that holder of Bond Service
Charges on such Bond at a place and
in a manner other than as provided in
the Trust Agreement and in such
Bond, but satisfactory to the Trustee
and the City; provided, however, that
(subject to the provisions of the final
sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph) payment of principal,
Appreciated Principal Amount, and
any premium shall be made only to or
for the account of the person in whose
name such Bond shall be registered
on the registration books on the date
on which such principal, Appreciated
Principal Amount, and premium are
due, and payment of interest shall be
made only to or for the account of the
person in whose name such Bond or
any Predecessor Bond shall have
been registered at the close of business on the applicable Regular
Record Date or Special Record Date,
as the case may be; and provided, further, however, that no such agreement shall alter or affect the manner
in which Bond Service Charges on
any Bond insured or secured by a
municipal bond insurance policy or a
line or letter of credit is to be paid by
the Credit Provider pursuant to any
provisions of the Trust Agreement or
any Supplemental Trust Agreement
with respect thereto. The Trustee
shall furnish to the City a certified
copy of any agreement entered into
pursuant to this subsection. Any payment of Bond Service Charges pursuant to and in accordance with such
an agreement shall constitute payment thereof pursuant to, and for all
purposes of, the Trust Agreement.
(f) In the event that a Person other
than the City pays to the Trustee or to
a Holder, pursuant to an agreement
with the City, an amount of money to
be used to pay directly or indirectly to
the Holders of Bonds an amount equal
to principal or Appreciated Principal
Amount of and any redemption premium or interest on the Bonds then
payable and such agreement contemplates that in exchange for such payment such Person will acquire from
the Holder its rights to the payment
of the amount of principal or Appreciated Principal Amount of and any
redemption premium or interest on
the Bonds then due, then such Person
upon such payment shall become the
owner of the principal or Appreciated
Principal Amount of and any redemption premium or interest on the Bonds
contemplated to be acquired by such
payment notwithstanding any other
provision of the Trust Agreement.
The Trustee shall pay any money
received by it from such Person to the
Holders as if it were the payment of
the principal or Appreciated Principal Amount of and any redemption
premium or interest on the Bonds
then due, and the Trustee or the Holder, whichever shall first receive such
payment, shall deliver to such Person
(i) in the case of interest on the
Bonds, an acknowledgement of such
Person’s ownership of interest to be
paid on the Bonds specifying the
amount of interest owned, the period
represented by such interest and the
numbers of the Bonds on which such
interest is owed, and (ii) in the case
of principal or Appreciated Principal

24

January 13, 2016
Amount of or premium on the Bonds,
either the Bonds themselves assigned
to such Person or new Bonds in
exchange for the Predecessor Bonds
naming such Person as the Holder.
Whenever moneys become available
for the payment of Defaulted Interest,
the Person to whom an acknowledgement as above has been delivered
shall be treated as to the Defaulted
Interest that is the subject of the
acknowledgement as if such Person
had been the Holder of the Bonds on
which such Defaulted Interest is
payable on the Special Record Date.
(g) Subject to the foregoing, each
Bond delivered under the Trust
Agreement upon transfer thereof, or
in exchange for or in replacement of
any other Bond, shall carry the rights
to interest accrued and unpaid, and to
accrue on that Bond, or that were carried by that Bond. Except as provided
in this Section 3 and in Section 5 hereof, (i) the Holder of any Bond shall be
deemed and regarded as the absolute
owner thereof for all purposes of the
Trust Agreement, (ii) payment of or
on account of the principal of or any
redemption premium or interest on
any Bond shall be made only to or
upon the order of that Holder or its
duly authorized attorney in the manner permitted by the Trust Agreement, and (iii) neither the City, the
Trustee, the Bond Registrar nor any
Paying Agent shall, to the extent permitted by law, be affected by notice to
the contrary. All of those payments
shall be valid and effective to satisfy
and discharge the liability upon that
Bond, including without limitation,
the interest thereon, to the extent of
the amount or amounts so paid.
(h) The Bonds shall be payable
solely from Net Revenues and, to the
extent provided herein and in the
Master Trust Agreement or any Supplemental Trust Agreement, the moneys and securities in the Special
Funds, and shall be secured only by
the Trust Agreement and by a pledge
of and lien on Net Revenues and on
the Funds and Subfunds (to the
extent the moneys and securities
therein constitute Net Revenues) and
on the Special Funds, subject, however, to the provisions of the Trust
Agreement providing for the application of Net Revenues and of the moneys and securities on deposit in the
various Funds and Subfunds. Neither
the State nor the City or its Council
shall be obligated to pay the principal
of or interest on the Bonds from any
other moneys or source, nor shall the
Bonds be a claim upon or lien against
any property of or under the control of
the City or the Council except Net
Revenues and the moneys and securities on deposit in the Special Funds.
The Bonds shall be secured equally
and ratably under the Trust Agreement without the priority of any Bond
over any other Bond (subject, however, to the provisions of the Trust
Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions of Section 5(d) of
this General Bond Ordinance regarding
the
applicability
of
credit
enhancement or liquidity support to a
particular Series of Bonds). The
pledge of and lien on Net Revenues
and the moneys and securities on
deposit in the Special Funds, as created hereby, shall from the date hereof
be valid and binding. The Net Revenues and the moneys and securities
on deposit in the Special Funds so

January 13, 2016
pledged and hereafter received shall
immediately be subject to the lien of
such pledge without any physical
delivery thereof or further act, and
such lien shall be valid and binding
against all parties having claims of
any kind in tort, contract or otherwise
against the City, irrespective of
whether such parties have notice
thereof. The Bonds do not constitute a
debt or a pledge of the faith and credit of the City or of the State or of any
political subdivision thereof, and the
Holders thereof shall have no right to
have taxes levied by the Council or by
the General Assembly of the State or
taxing authority of any political subdivision of the State for the payment
of the principal thereof or the interest
thereon. The pledge of Net Revenues
and the moneys and securities on
deposit in the Special Funds shall be
effective and the moneys therefrom
may be applied to the purposes for
which pledged, as contemplated herein, without necessity of any further
act of appropriation. Nothing in this
General Bond Ordinance shall be construed as pledging the general credit
of the City or that of the State or of
any political subdivision thereof to
the payment of the Bonds or any part
thereof or interest thereon.
Section 4. Replacement of Mutilated, Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Bonds.
In case any Bond is mutilated, lost,
stolen, or destroyed, the City shall
execute and deliver a Bond of like
authority and principal amount as the
Bond so mutilated, lost, stolen, or
destroyed, in exchange and substitution for such Bond in the manner provided in the Trust Agreement.

Issuance of Bonds.
(a) Authorization. The issuance
from time to time of Bonds is hereby
authorized without limitation as to

more Series as hereinafter provided,
for the purpose only of paying Capital
Costs,
or
refunding,
including
advance refunding, for any lawful
purpose, any Outstanding Bonds or
Subordinated Indebtedness where
such refunding will not adversely
affect the exclusion of the interest on
any Tax-Exempt Bonds from gross
income for purposes of federal income
taxation. The issuance of each Series
of Bonds shall be authorized by a Supplemental Bond Ordinance, which
may specify, or provide for the related
Certificate of Award or Supplemental
Trust Agreement to specify, (i) the
authorized principal amount and
Series designation of the Bonds, (ii)
the purpose for which such Series is
being issued; (iii) the date, and the
maturity date or dates, of the Bonds of
such Series; (iv) the interest rate or
rates of the Bonds of such Series, or
the manner of determining such rate
or rates, and the Interest Payment
Dates therefor, and, in the case of
Variable Rate Bonds, the maximum
rate of interest payable thereon, if
any; (v) the denominations of, and the
manner of dating, numbering and lettering, the Bonds of such Series; (vi)
the Paying Agent and the place or
places of payment of the Bonds of
such Series or the manner of appointing and designating the same; (vii)
the redemption prices, if any, and the
redemption terms for the Bonds of
such Series; (viii) the amount and due

The City Record
date of each Sinking Fund Installment, if any, for Term Bonds of such
Series, provided that the due date of
any Sinking Fund Installment shall
be an Interest Payment Date; (ix) the
amount of the Debt Service Reserve
Requirement, if any, with respect to
the Bonds of such Series; (x) provisions for the sale of the Bonds of such
Series; (xi) the forms of the Bonds of
such Series; and (xii) any other provisions deemed advisable by the City as
shall not conflict with the provisions
hereof and the of the Trust Agreement. A Supplemental Bond Ordinance may also authorize and provide
for the City to enter into one or more
Interest Rate Hedge Agreements
with respect to any Bonds that are
Outstanding or authorized to be
issued, and may do so prior to, simultaneously with, or subsequent to the
issuance of such Bonds. Additional
Bonds shall be equally and ratably
payable from Net Revenues and shall
be secured by a pledge of and lien on
Net Revenues and the Special Funds
on a parity with any other then Outstanding Bonds, subject, however, to
the provisions of the Trust Agreement providing for the application
thereof.
(b) Variable Rate Bonds. Any
Series of Bonds may be issued as Variable Rate Bonds. The Supplemental
Bond Ordinance and Supplemental
Trust Agreement applicable to any
Series of Variable Rate Bonds shall
specify the method and procedure by
which the rate of interest to be borne
thereby shall be determined, may provide for the right of the holders thereof to tender such Variable Rate Bonds
for purchase by the City at the times,
on the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth therein and may provide for more frequent deposits by the
City to the Debt Service Fund for
Bond Service Charges, in the event
that
payment
of
Bond
Service
Charges on such Variable Rate Bonds
is due more frequently than semiannually, but if deposits to the Debt Service Fund for Bond Service Charges
on any Series of Additional Bonds are
required to be made more frequently
than had been required for Bond Service Charges on any Outstanding
Bonds, then, from and after the
issuance of such Additional Bonds,
deposits to the Debt Service Fund
shall be required for all Outstanding
Bonds with the same frequency as
they are required for such Additional
Bonds.
(c) Capital Appreciation Bonds. All
or any portion of any Series of Additional Bonds may be issued as Capital
Appreciation Bonds.
(d) Credit Enhancement. In addition to the Net Revenues and the Special Funds and other amounts, proceeds, moneys, investments, rights,
and interests pledged and assigned
by the City to the Trustee under the
Trust Agreement to secure the payment of the Bond Service Charges, the
Supplemental Trust Agreement for
any Series of Bonds may provide for
credit enhancement or liquidity support applicable to such Series of
Bonds without any requirement that
the security or protection afforded by
such credit enhancement or liquidity
support extend or apply to the Bonds
of any other Series. The fees, charges,
and expenses initially payable to the
Credit Provider for any such credit

25

19
enhancement or liquidity support
may be paid from the proceeds of the
Bonds to which such credit enhancement or liquidity support applies. The
Supplemental Trust Agreement for
any Series of Bonds to which any such
credit enhancement or liquidity support applies may include provisions
permitting the Credit Provider to act
as, or in the place of, the holders of
such Bonds for the purposes and on
the terms and conditions set forth in
such Supplemental Trust Agreement.
(e) Bond Anticipation Notes. In
anticipation of the issuance of any
Series of Additional Bonds, the City
may issue one or more Series of Bond
Anticipation Notes. All requirements
of the Trust Agreement applicable to
Bonds shall apply to Bond Anticipation Notes, including, without limitation the conditions precedent for the
issuance of a Series of Bonds. For the
purpose of (i) determining compliance with the rate covenant set forth
in Section 20(c) of this General Bond
Ordinance for any period prior to the
date of calculation, (ii) determining
whether Additional Bonds may be
issued in compliance with the requirements in subsection (h)(iii) of this
Section when any Bond Anticipation
Notes are outstanding, (iii) determining whether Bond Anticipation Notes
may be issued in compliance with the
requirements in subsection (h)(iii) of
this Section, and (iv) determining the
amount of the Debt Service Reserve
Requirement attributable to such
Bond Anticipation Notes, the Debt
Service payable on any Bond Anticipation Notes shall be computed for
purposes of the Trust Agreement in
accordance with Section 7(b) hereof.
(f) Debt Service Reserve Requirement.
In
connection
with
any
issuance of Bonds, the City may, in
the applicable Supplemental Trust
Agreement, provide that no deposit to
the Debt Service Reserve Fund shall
be made for or with respect to such
Additional Bonds, in which case: (i)
the holders of such Additional Bonds
shall have no right or entitlement to
have any portion of the Bond Service
Charges on such Additional Bonds be
paid from any amounts in the Debt
Service Reserve Fund, (ii) the lien of
and pledge on the Debt Service
Reserve Fund shall not extend to or
be for the benefit of the holders of
such Bonds, and (iii) the Debt Service
on such Bonds shall not be taken into
account in determining the Debt Service Reserve Requirement.
In the event that the Supplemental
Trust Agreement applicable to an
issue of Additional Bonds provides as
described in the preceding paragraph,
then such Supplemental Trust Agreement may also provide for the creation of a special reserve account
solely for such Bonds, separate from
the Debt Service Reserve Fund, and
may provide for the deposit therein,
at the time of issuance or in one or
more subsequent deposits thereto, of
an amount specified in the applicable
Supplemental Trust Agreement as the
required reserve for such Bonds, or
may require the City to provide a
municipal bond insurance policy, a
bank letter or line of credit, or any
other form of credit or liquidity facility issued by a Qualified Financial
Institution to enhance the security for
such Bonds in lieu of a funded reserve
account. If the Supplemental Trust

20
Agreement applicable to such a Series
of Bonds so provides for such a special reserve account and further
requires that deposits be made thereto from Net Revenues at any time,
then such deposits may be made only
from moneys remaining in the Revenue Fund on the last day of a month
after any required deposits to the
Debt Service Reserve Fund.
If the Supplemental Trust Agreement applicable to a Series of Bonds
provides for no reserve account, or for
a special reserve account as permitted by the preceding paragraph, then
such Supplemental Trust Agreement
shall also provide that the amount of
any defaulted principal of or interest
on such Series of Bonds that would
have been timely paid had the Debt
Service Reserve Requirement for
such Bonds been funded in the Debt
Service Reserve Fund shall be paid
only from moneys remaining in the
Revenue Fund on the last day of a
month after any required deposits to
the Debt Service Reserve Fund.
(g) Series Certificate of Award.
The Supplemental Bond Ordinance
for any Series of Bonds may provide
that the rate or rates of interest to be
borne by such Bonds and the other
terms and conditions thereof may be
determined and the Original Purchaser(s) thereof may be designated in a
Series Certificate of Award, subject to
such limitations and requirements as
may be set forth in such Supplemental
Bond Ordinance.
(h) Conditions to Delivery. Prior to
the authentication and delivery of
any Series of Bonds, the City shall
deliver to the Trustee the following:
(i) A Certificate of the Director of
Finance and the Director of Law, certifying that, to their knowledge, the
City is not, on the date of issuance of
the Bonds, in default in the performance of any of its covenants provided in this General Bond Ordinance, in
the Trust Agreement or in the Bonds;
(ii) [RESERVED];
(iii) For any Series of Additional
Bonds that the City issues for the payment of Capital Costs or for the purpose of refunding Subordinated
Indebtedness or other obligations
other than Outstanding Bonds, either
(A) a Certificate of the Director of
Finance certifying that the Net Revenues Available for Debt Service for
the preceding Fiscal Year or any consecutive twelve (12) calendar months
during the eighteen (18)-month period immediately preceding the date of
original issuance of the proposed
Series of Bonds (in each case, the
“Test Period”) are in an amount not
less than the greater of (1) 120% of
maximum annual Debt Service on all
Bonds then Outstanding and on the
proposed Series of Additional Bonds
or (2) 100% of the sum of: (A) maximum annual Debt Service on any
Bonds then Outstanding and on the
proposed Series of Bonds, (B) all
required deposits to the Debt Service
Reserve Fund, (C) all required
deposits to the Subordinated Debt Service Fund and to any reserve fund
securing Subordinated Indebtedness,
(D) all required deposits to the Contingency Fund, and (E) debt service
payable on any other obligations
payable from the Balance Subfund
and deposits to any reserve funds
securing such other obligations, during that Test Period (the amounts

The City Record
described in clauses (A) through (E)
being referred to collectively as the
“Test Amount”), or (B) a Certificate
of the Director of Finance, which may
be, but is not required to be, accompanied by or based upon a Certificate of
a Consulting Engineer, certifying
that the Adjusted Net Revenues for
the Test Period are in an amount not
less than the greater of (1) 120% of
maximum annual Debt Service on any
Bonds then Outstanding and on the
proposed Series of Bonds or (2) 100%
of the Test Amount during that Test
Period. No certification under this
Section 5(h)(iii) shall be required for
any Series of Bonds being issued for
the purpose of refunding Outstanding
Bonds, provided that the issuance of
the refunding Bonds will not result in
any increase in Debt Service in any
Fiscal Year; otherwise, the same certification shall be required as for a
Series of Bonds for the payment of
Capital Costs;
(iv) For purposes of determining
the City’s compliance with the Additional Bonds test in Section 5(h)(iii),
the amount of any Direct Payment
received or expected to be received by
the City or the Trustee in any Fiscal
Year shall be credited against (i)
Debt Service in such Fiscal Year if
such Direct Payment relates to Bonds
or (ii) debt service on Subordinated
Indebtedness in such Fiscal Year if
such Direct Payment relates to Subordinated Indebtedness.
(v) A certified copy of the Supplemental Bond Ordinance authorizing
the issuance of the Bonds;
(vi) An original executed counterpart of the Supplemental Trust Agreement authorizing the issuance of the
Series of Bonds;

be deposited as provided in the applicable Supplemental Bond Ordinance or
Supplemental Trust Agreement;
(viii) The written opinion of counsel, who may be counsel for the City,
reasonably
satisfactory
to
the
Trustee, to the effect that: (A) the
documents submitted to the Trustee
in connection with the request then
being made comply with the requirements of the Trust Agreement; (B)
the issuance of the Bonds has been
duly authorized; and (C) all conditions precedent to the delivery of the
Bonds set forth in the Trust Agreement have been fulfilled; and

Counsel (who also may be the counsel
to which reference is made in paragraph (viii)), to the effect that: (A)
when executed for and in the name
and on behalf of the City and when
authenticated and delivered by the
Trustee, those Bonds will be valid and
legal obligations of the City in accordance with their terms with customary exceptions for bankruptcy and
creditors’ rights and general principles of equity; and (B) the issuance of
the Bonds will not result in the interest on Tax-Exempt Bonds outstanding
immediately
prior
to
that
issuance ceasing to be excluded from
gross income for purposes of federal
income taxation.

26

January 13, 2016
(i) The proceeds of the sale of any
Series of Additional Bonds shall be
applied as provided in the Supplemental Bond Ordinance or Supplemental
Trust Agreement authorizing such
Bonds.
(j) The Supplemental Bond Ordinance authorizing any Series of
Bonds
shall
incorporate
the
covenants and requirements of this
General Bond Ordinance insofar as
applicable to all Bonds.
Section 6. Subordinated Indebtedness.
(a) The City may, at any time and
from time to time, issue or incur Subordinated Indebtedness for the purpose of financing any Capital Costs,
provided that such Subordinated
Indebtedness is secured solely by, and
is payable solely from, moneys on
deposit in the Subordinated Debt Service Fund, or the Balance Subfund or
both.
(b) Any Supplemental Trust Agreement providing for the issuance of
Subordinated Indebtedness shall provide that the trustee for such Subordinated Indebtedness shall have no
right, power or authority to cause
acceleration of such Subordinated
Indebtedness unless and until the
Trustee has exercised its power to
accelerate the Bonds.
Section 7. Computation of Debt Service.
(a) In the event that all or any portion of any Series of Bonds have been
issued as or are proposed to be issued
as Variable Rate Bonds, then, except
as otherwise provided in paragraph
(f) of this Section, in order to compute
the Debt Service on such Bonds for
the purposes of the Trust Agreement,
the following rules shall apply:
(i) For the purpose of determining
compliance with the rate covenant set
forth in Section 20(c) of this General
Bond Ordinance for any period prior
to the date of calculation, the rate of
interest borne by any Outstanding
Variable Rate Bonds shall be deemed
to be the actual weighted average
rate in effect thereon during such
period;
(ii) For the purpose of determining
whether Bonds may be issued in compliance with the requirements in subsection (h)(iii) of Section 5 of this
General Bond Ordinance, regardless
of whether such Bonds are to be Variable Rate Bonds, the rate of interest
to be borne by any Outstanding Variable Rate Bonds shall be deemed to be
the highest rate of interest borne by
such Variable Rate Bonds during the
preceding twenty-four (24) months,
but if such Variable Rate Bonds have
not been outstanding for twenty-four
(24) months preceding the date of the
computation, then it is to be assumed
that such Variable Rate Bonds will
bear interest at a fixed interest rate
equal to 120% of the highest rate
applicable within the twenty-four
(24) months immediately preceding
the date of the computation under an
index generally accepted in the securities industry for securities having
ratings and maturity or tender dates
comparable to those of the Outstanding Variable Rate Bonds.
(iii) For the purpose of determining
whether Bonds that are to be Variable
Rate Bonds may be issued in compliance with the requirements in subsection (h)(iii) of Section 5 of this General Bond Ordinance, and for the purpose of determining the amount of the
Debt Service Reserve Requirement, if

January 13, 2016
any, attributable to such Variable
Rate Bonds, the rate of interest to be
borne by such Variable Rate Bonds
shall be deemed to be a fixed interest
rate equal to 120% of the highest rate
applicable within the twenty-four
(24) months immediately preceding
the date of the computation under an
index generally accepted in the securities industry for securities having
ratings and maturity or tender dates
comparable to those of the proposed
Variable Rate Bonds.
(iv) For the purpose of determining
whether any Outstanding Variable
Rate Bond is deemed paid and discharged for purposes of Article VIII
of the Master Trust Agreement, such
Variable Rate Bond shall be deemed
to bear interest at the actual rate of
interest borne thereby for the remainder of the period that such rate shall
remain in effect, and for any subsequent period prior to the date on
which such Variable Rate Bond is
actually to be paid and discharged,
such Variable Rate Bond shall be
deemed to bear interest at the maximum rate of interest such Variable
Rate Bond may bear pursuant to the
Supplemental
Trust
Agreement
applicable thereto.
(b) Regarding any Bonds that are
or are proposed to be issued as Balloon Bonds, for the purpose of (i)
determining compliance with the rate
covenant set forth in subsection (c) of
Section 20 of this General Bond Ordinance for any period prior to the date
of calculation, (ii) determining
whether Bonds, regardless of whether
they are to be Balloon Bonds, may be
issued in compliance with the requirements in subsection (h)(iii) of Section 5 of this General Bond Ordinance
when any Balloon Bonds are outstanding, (iii) determining whether
Bonds that are to be Balloon Bonds
may be issued in compliance with the
requirements in subsection (h)(iii) of
Section 5 of this General Bond Ordinance, and (iv) determining the
amount of the Debt Service Reserve
Requirement, if any, attributable to
such Balloon Bonds, the Debt Service
on such Bonds shall be determined:
(A) if such Balloon Bonds are not
Capital
Appreciation
Bonds,
by
assuming that such Balloon Bonds
are to be amortized on the basis of
level debt service over the Assumed
Amortization Period and that such
Bonds bear interest at the Assumed
Interest Rate; and
(B) if such Balloon Bonds are Capital Appreciation Bonds, by assuming
that
the
Appreciated
Principal
Amount of such Bonds at maturity is
to be amortized on the basis of level
principal payments over the Assumed
Amortization Period.
(c) If any outstanding Bonds have
been refunded by any Crossover
Refunding Bonds, then any principal
of and premium on such Crossover
Refunded Bonds to be paid from a
Crossover Escrow Fund shall be
excluded from Debt Service. If any
outstanding Bonds are Crossover
Refunding Bonds issued to refund
any Bonds, then any interest paid or
to be paid on such Crossover Refunding Bonds from any Crossover
Escrow Fund shall be excluded from
Debt Service.
(d) Debt Service shall not include
payments potentially required to be
made by the City under any Reimbursement Agreement to reimburse
any Credit Provider for payments

The City Record
made to pay the principal of or interest or any premium on the Bonds, but
Debt Service shall include such payments if the City’s obligation to make
such payments shall have accrued
and become actual.
(e) Regarding any Bonds that are
or are proposed to be issued as Capital
Appreciation Bonds, for the purpose
of (i) determining compliance with
the rate covenant set forth in subsection (c) of Section 20 of this General
Bond Ordinance for any period prior
to the date of calculation, (ii) determining whether Bonds, regardless of
whether they are to be Capital Appreciation Bonds, may be issued in compliance with the requirements in subsection (h)(iii) of Section 5 of this
General Bond Ordinance when any
Capital Appreciation Bonds are outstanding, (iii) determining whether
Bonds that are to be Capital Appreciation Bonds may be issued in compliance with the requirements in subsection (h)(iii) of Section 5 of this General Bond Ordinance, and (iv) determining the amount of the Debt Service Reserve Requirement attributable to such Capital Appreciation
Bonds, the Debt Service on such
Bonds shall include the Appreciated
Principal Amounts at maturity.
(f) If the City enters into an Interest Rate Hedge Agreement to simulate a fixed rate of interest on Variable Rate Bonds, then the City may
(1) secure the portion of the payment
obligations of the City thereunder
that represents the equivalent of
interest on the notional amount of the
Interest Rate Hedge Agreement with
a pledge of the Net Revenues on a parity with the pledge thereof that
secures the Bonds, and (2) cause the
debt structure that is simulated
through the combination of the Variable Rate Bonds with such Interest
Rate Hedge Agreement to apply for
purposes of calculating or projecting
the Debt Service on such Variable
Rate Bonds for any period of time during which such Interest Rate Hedge
Agreement is to be effective, provided
that (i) the debt structure that is simulated through the combination of the
Variable Rate Bonds with such Interest Rate Hedge Agreement complies
with the restrictions of the Trust
Agreement on the terms of and security for the Bonds applied to that
structure as though it consisted
entirely of Bonds and as though the
portion of the payment obligations of
the City thereunder that represents
the equivalent of interest on the
notional amount of the Interest Rate
Hedge Agreement payable to the
counterparty to the Interest Rate
Hedge Agreement constituted Bond
Service Charges, (ii) the counterparty to any swap agreement and the
provider of any interest rate cap is
rated either of the two highest rating
categories by at least two Rating
Agencies, (iii) no such Interest Rate
Hedge Agreement purports to entitle
the counterparty to the Interest Rate
Hedge Agreement to payment by the
City from any source other than the
Net Revenues, but such Interest Rate
Hedge Agreement may provide for
securing any portion of the payment
obligations of the City thereunder
that represents the equivalent of
interest on the notional amount of the
Interest Rate Hedge Agreement (but
does not represent, among other
things, any termination payment that

27

21
may be payable by the City thereunder) with a pledge of the Net Revenues on a parity with the pledge
thereof that secures the Bonds; and
(iv) the cost of obtaining such Interest Rate Hedge Agreement has been
by
the
Director
of
determined
Finance (who may obtain the written
advice of a Financial Advisor) to be
justified by the corresponding benefit
to the City and to be commercially
reasonable based on then current
market conditions. In the event the
City enters into any such Interest
Rate Hedge Agreement, it shall not
exercise any option to terminate such
Interest Rate Hedge Agreement
unless the Variable Rate Bonds to
which such Interest Rate Hedge
Agreement had related and that will
remain outstanding after the termination thereof would fulfill the requirements of the Trust Agreement as they
apply to Variable Rate Bonds, as
though such Variable Rate Bonds
were being issued on the date of the
termination of such Interest Rate
Hedge Agreement. If deposits to the
Debt Service Fund for Parity Swap
Obligations created pursuant this
paragraph are required to be made
more frequently than had been
required for Bond Service Charges on
any Outstanding Bonds, then, from
and after the time such deposits for
Parity Swap Obligations commence,
deposits to the Debt Service Fund
shall be required for all Outstanding
Bonds with the same frequency as
they are required for such Parity
Swap Obligations.
(g) If the City enters into an Interest Rate Hedge Agreement to simulate a variable rate of interest on
fixed rate Bonds, then the City may
(1) secure the portion of the payment
obligations of the City thereunder
that represents the equivalent of
interest on the notional amount of the
Interest Rate Hedge Agreement with
a pledge of the Net Revenues on a parity with the pledge thereof that
secures the Bonds, and (2) cause the
debt structure that is simulated
through the combination of the fixed
rate Bonds with such Interest Rate
Hedge Agreement to apply for purposes of calculating or projecting the
Debt Service on such fixed rate Bonds
for any period of time during which
such Interest Rate Hedge Agreement
is to be effective, provided that (i) the
debt structure that is simulated
through the combination of the fixed
rate Bonds with such Interest Rate
Hedge Agreement complies with the
restrictions of the Trust Agreement
on the terms of and security for the
Bonds applied to that structure as
though it consisted entirely of Variable Rate Bonds and as though the
portion of the payment obligations of
the City thereunder that represents
the equivalent of interest on the
notional amount of the Interest Rate
Hedge Agreement payable to the
counterparty to the Interest Rate
Hedge Agreement constituted Bond
Service Charges, (ii) the counterparty to any swap agreement and the
provider of any interest rate cap is
rated either of the two highest rating
categories by at least two Rating
Agencies, (iii) no such Interest Rate
Hedge Agreement purports to entitle
the counterparty to the Interest Rate
Hedge Agreement to payment by the
City from any source other than the

22
Net Revenues, but such Interest Rate
Hedge Agreement may provide for
securing any portion of the payment
obligations of the City thereunder
that represents the equivalent of
interest on the notional amount of the
Interest Rate Hedge Agreement (but
does not represent, among other
things, any termination payment that
may be payable by the City thereunder) with a pledge of the Net Revenues on a parity with the pledge
thereof that secures the Bonds; and
(iv) the cost of obtaining such Interest Rate Hedge Agreement has been
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance (who may obtain the written
advice of a financial advisor) to be
justified by the corresponding benefit
to the City and to be commercially
reasonable based on then current
market conditions. In the event the
City enters into any such Interest
Rate Hedge Agreement, it shall not
exercise any option to terminate such
Interest Rate Hedge Agreement
unless the fixed rate Bonds to which
such Interest Rate Hedge Agreement
had related and that will remain outstanding after the termination thereof would fulfill the requirements of
the Trust Agreement as they apply to
fixed rate Bonds, as though such
fixed rate Bonds were being issued on
the date of the termination of such
Interest Rate Hedge Agreement. If
deposits to the Debt Service Fund for
Parity Swap Obligations created pursuant this paragraph are required to
be made more frequently than had
been required for Bond Service
Charges on any Outstanding Bonds,
then, from and after the time such
deposits for Parity Swap Obligations
commence, deposits to the Debt Service Fund shall be required for all
Outstanding Bonds with the same frequency as they are required for such
Parity Swap Obligations.
Section 8. Establishment of Funds
and Subfunds.
(a) The City hereby establishes and
creates the following special trust
funds and subfunds:
(1) Construction Fund;
(2) Revenue Fund, containing:
an Operating Subfund, a Working
Capital Subfund, and a
Balance Subfund;
(3) Debt Service Fund, containing
an
Interest Subfund, and
Principal Subfund;
(4) Debt Service Reserve Fund;
(5) Subordinated Debt Service
Fund;
(6) Contingency Fund;
(7) Rate Stabilization Fund; and
(8) Rebate Fund.
(b) The Trustee shall establish (i)
separate subaccounts in the Interest
Subfund and Principal Subfund of the
Debt Service Fund for each Series of
Bonds, (ii) separate subaccounts in
the Debt Service Reserve Fund for
any and each Series of Bonds to which
the Debt Service Reserve Fund
applies, and (iii) separate subaccounts in the Construction Fund for
each Series of Bonds with proceeds
required to be deposited in the Construction Fund.
(c) The Revenue Fund and the Subfunds therein, the Contingency Fund
and the Rate Stabilization Fund each
shall be held by the City and not commingled with other moneys of the
City except for purposes of investment. The Debt Service Fund, Debt

The City Record
Service Reserve Fund, Construction
Fund and Rebate Fund each shall be
held by the Trustee. The Subordinated Debt Service Fund shall be held by
the City or by the Trustee or such
trustee or other party as may be specified in the trust agreement or other
contract between the City and the
holder or holders of the Subordinated
Indebtedness. All moneys or securities deposited with the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement shall be
held in trust and applied only in
accordance with the provisions hereof
and shall be considered trust funds
for the purposes of the Trust Agreement.
Section 9. Construction Fund.
(a) There shall be deposited from
time to time in the Construction Fund
the portion of the proceeds of the
Bonds required to be deposited therein by any Supplemental Bond Ordinance and Supplemental Trust Agreement.
(b) Amounts in the Construction
Fund shall be expended only to pay
Capital Costs and Costs of Issuance or
to cure any deficiency in the Debt Service Fund or the Debt Service Reserve
Fund following the deposits required
pursuant to Section 10 hereof.
Section 10. Revenue Fund. From
and after the authentication and
delivery of the Series 2016 Bonds to
the Original Purchasers thereof, the
City shall cause all cash receipts that
constitute Revenues and any amounts
that the City elects to transfer to the
Revenue Fund from the Rate Stabilization Fund pursuant to Section 15
to be deposited promptly in the Revenue Fund. In each month, the
amounts in the Revenue Fund shall
be deposited in the Operating Subfund and first applied to the payment
of Operating Expenses; thereafter,
the balance in the Revenue Fund up
to the Working Capital Reserve shall
be deposited in the Working Capital
Reserve Subfund and retained as a
reserve for the payment of Operating
Expenses and used for that purpose if
the Operating Subfund shall have
been fully expended; and thereafter,
the balance in the Revenue Fund
shall be paid at the times and in the
amounts as follows:
(a) To the Trustee for deposit in the
Debt Service Fund as follows:
1. Monthly, on or before the last day
of each month, the City shall pay to
the Trustee, for deposit in each subaccount in the Interest Subfund in the
Debt Service Fund, an amount equal
to one-sixth of the amount of interest
due on the next Interest Payment
Date on the Outstanding Bonds of the
Series to which such subaccount
relates; provided, however, that if
fewer than six months precede the
next Interest Payment Date, then, on
or before the last day of each such
month an amount that, if deposited in
each such month, would equal the
amount of interest due on the next
Interest Payment Date on the Outstanding Bonds of the Series to which
such subaccount relates shall be
deposited therein; provided further,
however, such monthly payments
need be made only to the extent that
the amount then on deposit in any
such subaccount is less than the
amount required to be on deposit
therein in accordance herewith; and
provided yet further, however, that
the frequency and amount of any
deposits required by this paragraph

28

January 13, 2016
shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to Sections 5(b) or 7(f) or (g) of
this General Bond Ordinance.
2. Monthly, on or before the last day
of each of the twelve months that precede a month in which a Serial Maturity Date occurs or a Sinking Fund
Installment is due, the City shall pay
to the Trustee for deposit in each
applicable subaccount in the Principal Subfund in the Debt Service Fund
an amount equal to one-twelfth of the
amount necessary to provide for the
payment of the principal due on the
next Serial Maturity Date or of the
next Sinking Fund Installment; provided, however, that if fewer than
twelve months precede the next
month in which a Serial Maturity
Date occurs or a Sinking Fund Installment is due, then, on or before the last
day of each such month an amount
that, if deposited in each such month,
would equal the amount of principal
due on the next Serial Maturity Date
or of the next Sinking Fund Installment for the Outstanding Bonds of the
Series to which such subaccount
relates shall be deposited therein; provided further, however, such monthly
payments need be made only to the
extent that the amount then on
deposit in any such subaccount is less
than the amount required to be on
deposit therein in accordance herewith; and provided yet further, however, that the frequency and amount
of any deposits required by this paragraph shall be subject to adjustment
pursuant to Sections 5(b) or 7(f) or
(g) of this General Bond Ordinance.
(b) To the Trustee for deposit in the
Debt Service Reserve Fund, monthly
on or before the last day of each
month, commencing on the date set
forth in the applicable Supplemental
Bond Ordinance with respect to any
Series of Bonds for which the Debt
Service Reserve Requirement is to be
deposited in the Debt Service Reserve
Fund, the City shall pay to the
Trustee for deposit in the subaccount
established in the Debt Service
Reserve Fund for such Series of Additional Bonds, an amount such that, if
that same amount were deposited in
equal monthly installments, the
aggregate of the amounts so deposited in such subaccount would be equal
to the Debt Service Reserve Requirement with respect to such Series of
Additional Bonds on the fifth (5th)
anniversary of such commencement
date, after giving effect to any
amounts already on deposit therein
and pledged to such Series of Additional Bonds. Thereafter, if the
amount on deposit in such subaccount
at any time is less than the Debt Service Reserve Requirement with
respect to such Series of Additional
Bonds, the City shall pay to the
Trustee for deposit in such subaccount, on the before following the
date of such deficiency, an amount
equal to one-twelfth of such deficiency. The frequency and amount of any
deposits required by this paragraph
shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to Sections 5(b) or 7(f) or (g)
and 10(a) of this General Bond Ordinance so that the deposits required by
this paragraph for any Series of
Bonds shall be no less frequent than
the deposits required by Section 10(a)
for the principal of and interest on
such Bonds.
(c) To any custodians of the Subordinated Debt Service Fund for deposit

January 13, 2016
therein, such amounts as are required
to be deposited therein on such dates
as are specified in the Supplemental
Trust Agreement or other contracts
between the City and the holder or
holders of the Subordinated Indebtedness. If any Supplemental Trust
Agreement or other contract between
the City and the holder or holders of
Subordinated Indebtedness requires
the establishment and funding a
reserve account related to such Subordinated Indebtedness, then any
required deposits to such reserve
account may be made after any
deposits otherwise required by this
paragraph (c) but before any deposits
required under paragraphs (d) and
(e) of this Section.
(d) To the Contingency Fund,
monthly on or before the last day of
each month on which the balance in
the Contingency Fund is less than the
Contingency Fund Requirement, not
less than one-twelfth (1/12) of the
amount by which the Contingency
Fund Requirement exceeds the balance.
(e) To the Rate Stabilization Fund,
on any date on which deposits are
required pursuant to paragraphs (a)
through (d), inclusive, of this Section
and after all such deposits are made,
any amounts that the City elects to
make to the Rate Stabilization Fund.
(f) On the first day of each Fiscal
Year or on the first practicable date
thereafter, the City shall deposit any
balance remaining in the Operating
Subfund and the Working Capital
Reserve Subfund in excess of the
Working Capital Reserve at the end
of the preceding Fiscal Year to the
credit of the Balance Subfund; provided, that the City may at any time provide for semiannual or quarterly
deposits of such Net Revenues to the
Balance Subfund.
(g) Upon receipt of any Direct Payment, the City or the Trustee shall
cause it to be deposited (i) in the
appropriate subaccount in the Debt
Service Fund if such Direct Payment
relates to Bonds, and (ii) in the appropriate account in the Subordinated
Debt Service Fund if such Direct Payment relates to Subordinated Indebtedness, and shall cause it to be
applied solely to the purposes to
which the Trust Agreement permits
funds in such subaccount and account
to be applied.
Section 11. Debt Service Fund.
(a) The Trustee shall pay out of the
applicable subaccounts in the Interest Subfund and in the Principal Subfund in the applicable Debt Service
Fund to each Paying Agent (i) on or
before each Interest Payment Date
for the Bonds of each Series (x) the
amount required for the interest
payable on all such Outstanding
Bonds on such date and (y) the
amount, if any, required for the payment of the principal maturing on all
such Outstanding Bonds on such date,
as provided in Section 10(a)(2) hereof, and (ii) on or before the day preceding the redemption date for any
such Bonds to be redeemed at the
option of the City, the amount
required for the payment of such
Bonds then to be redeemed. Such
amounts shall be so applied by each
Paying Agent on and after the due
date thereof.
(b) The City shall pay to the
Trustee for deposit in the Debt Service Fund any moneys held in any
other Funds or Subfunds in excess of

The City Record
the amounts required to be maintained therein that the City has elected to apply to the redemption prior to

amounts shall be so applied by the
Trustee in the manner and at the
times provided in the Trust Agreement.
(c) Amounts in the applicable subaccount in the Principal Subfund for
the payment of any Sinking Fund
Installment for the Term Bonds of
any Series then Outstanding (together with amounts in the applicable subaccount in the Interest Subfund with
respect to the Term Bonds for which
such Sinking Fund Installment was
established) shall be applied by the
Trustee to the redemption of Term
Bonds of the Series and maturity for
which such Sinking Fund Installment
was established in an amount not
exceeding that necessary to effect the
mandatory redemption of such Term
Bonds on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates. The Trustee shall, by giving
notice as provided in the Trust Agreement, proceed to call for redemption
on the due date of any such Sinking
Fund Installment the Term Bonds of
the Series and maturity for which
such Sinking Fund Installment was
established (except in the case of
Term Bonds maturing on a Sinking
Fund Installment date), in such
amount as shall be necessary to effect
the mandatory redemption of such
Term Bonds on the Mandatory
Redemption Date in an amount equal
to the amount of such Sinking Fund
Installment. The principal amount of
Term Bonds of such Series and maturity theretofore delivered by the City
to the Trustee to satisfy such Sinking
Fund Installment, in the manner and
to the extent as may be provided in
this General Bond Ordinance or in the
Supplemental Bond Ordinance or Supplemental Trust Agreement authorizing such Series, shall be credited
against the amount of such Sinking
Fund Installment. Such notice shall
be given regardless of whether or not
moneys therefor shall have been
deposited in the Principal Subfund in
the applicable Debt Service Fund and
without any instructions of the City.
The Trustee shall pay out of the Principal Subfund in the applicable Debt
Service Fund to the appropriate Paying Agent, on or before the day preceding such Mandatory Redemption
Date, the amount required for the
redemption of the Term Bonds so
called for redemption, and such
amount shall be applied by such Paying Agent to such redemption. All
expenses in connection with such
redemption of Term Bonds shall be
paid by the City from the Operating
Subfund.
(d) To the extent that a Series of
Bonds is secured by credit enhancement or liquidity support provided by
a Credit Provider pursuant to a Reimbursement Agreement, the Supplemental Bond Ordinance and Supplemental Trust Agreement with respect
to that Series may provide that the
Trustee shall apply amounts in the
Debt Service Fund first, to the payment of Bond Service Charges and
any Parity Swap Obligations then due
and, second, to the payment of any
Credit Obligations then due.

the amount in the subaccount in the

Reserve Fund to the extent necessary
to make good any such deficiency (or
the entire amount in the applicable

Section 17. Rebate Fund. There is
hereby established and ordered to be
maintained as a separate deposit
account (except when invested as
hereinafter provided) in the custody
of the Trustee a Rebate Fund. Any
provision hereof or of the Trust
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Rebate Fund is not
pledged to the payment of Bond Service Charges, is not one of or part of
any of the Special Funds, and is free
and clear of any lien hereunder. Separate accounts shall be created in the
Rebate Fund for each Series of Bonds,
commencing with the Series 2016
Bonds.
At least five days prior to the end of
the fifth Bond Year and each fifth
Bond Year thereafter for each Series
of Bonds, including the Series 2016
Bonds, and within five (5) days after
the date on which all outstanding
Bonds of such Series are paid or
deemed paid in full, the City shall calculate or shall furnish information to
and engage an independent certified
public accounting firm that is not
unacceptable to the Trustee, to calculate, the Rebate Amount as of the end
of that Bond Year or the date of such
final payment. The Trustee may rely
upon the City for the calculation of
the Rebate Amount, provided that the
Trustee receives a verification of the
accuracy of such computations by a
firm of independent certified public
accountants or an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel that such
computations are in compliance with
the Code. Within thirty (30) days
after the end of the fifth (5th) Bond
Year and every fifth (5th) Bond Year
thereafter, the Trustee, acting on
behalf of the City and at the written
direction of the City, shall pay to the
United States in accordance with Section 148(f) of the Code from the moneys then on deposit in the applicable
account in the Rebate Fund an

30

January 13, 2016
amount equal to 90% (or such greater
percentage not in excess of 100% as
the City may direct the Trustee in
writing to pay) of the Rebate Amount
determined from the date of the original delivery of the Bonds of that
Series (less the portion of the Rebate
Amount, if any, previously paid to the
United States pursuant to this Section). Within sixty (60) days after the
payment in full of all outstanding
Bonds of such Series and upon written
direction of the City, the Trustee shall
pay to the United States in accordance
with Section 148(f) of the Code from
the moneys then on deposit in the
applicable account in the Rebate
Fund an amount equal to 100% of the
Rebate Amount determined from the
date of the original delivery of the
Bonds of that Series to the date of
such payment (but less that portion of
the Rebate Amount, if any, previously
paid to the United States pursuant to
this Section) and any moneys remaining in the applicable account in the
Rebate Fund following such payment
shall be paid to the City. Notwithstanding anything in this General
Bond Ordinance to the contrary, the
moneys needed for any payment
required by the preceding two sentences may be derived from balances
in any of the Special Funds other than
the Debt Service Fund and the Debt
Service Reserve Fund, and the City
agrees to apply those balances to that
purpose in the following Order: the
Balance Subfund, the Rate Stabilization Fund, the Contingency Fund, the
Subordinated Indebtedness Fund and
any related reserve fund or account,
and the Construction Fund.
The Trustee shall keep such
records as are provided to it of the
computations made pursuant to this
Section as are required under Section
148(f) of the Code.
The Trustee shall keep and make
available to the City such records concerning the investments of the gross
proceeds of the Bonds and the investments of earnings from those investments as may be requested by the
City in order to enable the City to
make the computations required
under Section 148(f) of the Code.
If all the gross proceeds of the
Bonds of any Series, within the meaning of Section 148(f) of the Code, are
expended for the governmental purpose for which that Series of Bonds
was issued within six (6) months of
the date of issuance of that Series and
it is not expected that any other gross
proceeds of that Series of Bonds will
arise in the future, the provisions of
this Section 17 apply only to gross proceeds of that Series of Bonds, if any,
that actually do subsequently arise.
At the written request of the City,
any moneys held as part of the Rebate
Fund shall be invested or reinvested
by the Trustee in Eligible Investments. At no time shall any funds constituting gross proceeds of any such
Series of Bonds be used in any manner
to cause or result in a prohibited payment under applicable Treasury Regulations pertaining to, or in any other
fashion as would constitute failure of
compliance with, Section 148 of the
Code.
If at any time the City has received
a written opinion of Bond Counsel
that failure to comply with this Section 17 or any part hereof would not
adversely affect the exclusion of
interest on any Tax-Exempt Bonds

January 13, 2016
from gross income for federal income
tax purposes, the City may discontinue compliance with this Section 17 to
the extent set forth in such opinion.
Section 18. Investment of Funds and
Subfunds.
(a) Moneys held in the Debt Service
Reserve Fund or in any special
reserve account established pursuant
to Section 5(f) hereof shall be invested and reinvested, in accordance with
written instructions received from
the City, by the Trustee, to the fullest
extent practicable, in Eligible Investments maturing not later than the
final maturity of the Series of Bonds
for which the applicable subaccount
was established or subject to withdrawal at any time required for purposes of the Debt Service Reserve
Fund.
(b) Moneys held in the Debt Service
Fund shall be invested and reinvested, in accordance with written
instructions from the City, by the
Trustee, to the fullest extent possible,
in Eligible Investments maturing
within one (1) year from the date of
purchase but in any event not later
than such times as shall be necessary
to provide moneys for payments to be
made from such Funds as required
herein or subject to withdrawal at
any such time.
(c) Except as otherwise provided in
this General Bond Ordinance with
respect to the investment of moneys
in the Debt Service Fund and the Debt
Service Reserve Fund or any special
reserve account established pursuant
to Section 5(f) hereof, and only to the
extent otherwise provided, moneys
held in the Funds and Subfunds shall
be invested and reinvested by the City
and the Trustee, as the case may be,
to the fullest extent practicable, in
Eligible Investments that mature or
are subject to withdrawal not later
than such times as shall be necessary
to provide moneys for payments to be
made from such Funds and Subfunds,
as required herein and in the applicable Supplemental Bond Ordinance or
Supplemental Trust Agreement; provided, however, that the Trustee shall
make such investments only in accordance with instructions received from
the City.
(d) An investment that can be
redeemed at the option of the holder
or that may be sold at a pre-established price to a “Qualified Purchase
Agreement Provider” (as hereinafter
defined) pursuant to a written agreement within a specified time period
shall be deemed to mature within that
specified time period for purposes of
limitations in this General Bond Ordinance on the maximum maturity of
investments, but only for as long as
the redemption or sale option remains
exercisable within the specified period. For purposes of this Section 18(d),
a “Qualified Purchase Agreement
Provider” means a financial institution, including, without limitation, a
bank (including the Trustee or any of
its affiliates) or insurance company)
that is rated, or the obligations of
which are rated, in one of the top two
rating categories by at least two Rating Agencies.
Section 19. Valuation and Sale of
Investments.
(a) In computing the amount in any
Fund or Subfund established under
the provisions of this General Bond
Ordinance, obligations purchased as
an investment of moneys therein

The City Record
shall be valued at the lower of market
value or the amortized value thereof.
Amortized value, when used with
respect to an obligation purchased at
par, means the par amount thereof,
and, when used with respect to an
obligation purchased at a premium
above or a discount below par, means
the value as of any given time
obtained by dividing the total premium or discount at which such obligation was purchased by the number of
interest payments remaining on such
obligation after such purchase and
deducting the amount thus calculated
for each interest payment date after
such purchase from the purchase
price in the case of an obligation purchased at a premium and adding the
amount thus calculated for each interest payment date after such purchase
to the purchase price in the case of an
obligation purchased at a discount.
(b) Except as otherwise provided
herein, the Trustee shall sell at the
best price obtainable, using reasonable diligence to determine such best
price, or present for redemption, any
obligation so purchased as an investment whenever it shall be so requested in writing by the Director of
Finance or whenever it shall be necessary in order to provide moneys to
meet any payment or transfer from
any Fund held by it.
(c) Investments purchased as an
investment of moneys in any Fund or
Subfund shall be deemed at all times
to be a part of such Fund or Subfund,
and any losses suffered due to the
investment thereof shall be charged
to such Fund or Subfund. A deficiency
in a Subfund in the Debt Service
Reserve Fund shall not be deemed to
exist as of a date of transfer for the
purposes of this subsection (c) if the
amount on deposit therein is less than
the applicable Debt Service Reserve
Requirement with respect to any
Series of Bonds solely because as of
such date of transfer one or more
deposits to such Subfund in the Debt
Service Reserve Fund is not required
in connection with the original
issuance of such Series until a future
date or dates.
(d) The valuation and sale of
investments as provided in this Section 19 may be amended in the Master
Trust Agreement or any Supplemental Trust Agreement upon the request
of a Credit Provider.
Section 20. Covenants of the City.
The City hereby covenants with the
Holders of the Bonds as follows:
(a) The City shall maintain the System, or shall cause the System to be
maintained, in sound operating condition and free from any liens or encumbrances that would interfere with the
full and continuous use and operation
thereof by the City.
(b) The City shall keep proper
books of record and account so as to
show the complete financial results of
the operation of the System, including
Revenues and Operating Expenses
and all capital expenditures therefor,
and shall invest and deposit cash
receipts that constitute Revenues in
accordance with applicable laws, this
General Bond Ordinance and the
Trust Agreement.
(c) The City shall at all times prescribe, charge and collect such rates,
rentals and other charges for the use
of the services of the System and shall
restrict the Operating Expenses of
the System in such a way that Net

31

25
Revenues Available for Debt Service
(adjusted for purposes of clause (i)
as described in the following sentence) in each Fiscal Year shall be
not less than the greater of (i) 120%
of Debt Service on all Bonds then Outstanding payable during that Fiscal
Year or (ii) 100% of the sum of: (A)
Debt Service on all Bonds then Outstanding payable during that Fiscal
Year, (B) all required deposits to the
Debt Service Reserve Fund during
that Fiscal Year, (C) all required
deposits to the Subordinated Debt Service Fund and to any reserve fund
securing Subordinated Indebtedness
during that Fiscal Year, (D) all
required deposits to the Contingency
Fund during that Fiscal Year, and
(E) debt service payable on any other
obligations payable from the Balance
Subfund and deposits to any reserve
funds securing such other obligations
during that Fiscal Year. For purposes
of clause (i) of the preceding sentence, but not for the purpose of
clause (ii) of the preceding sentence,
“Net Revenues Available for Debt Service” for any Fiscal Year shall
include any amounts transferred
from the Rate Stabilization Fund to
the Revenue Fund during such Fiscal
Year, but shall be reduced by any
amounts transferred from the Revenue Fund to the Rate Stabilization
Fund during that period. For purposes of determining the City’s compliance with the rate covenant contained
in this Section 20(d), the amount of
any Direct Payments received by the
City or the Trustee in any Fiscal Year
shall be credited against (i) Debt Service in such Fiscal Year if such Direct
Payment related to Bonds or (ii) debt
service on Subordinated Indebtedness
in such Fiscal Year if such Direct
Payment related to Subordinated
Indebtedness.
(d) If in any Fiscal Year the Net
Revenues Available for Debt Service
shall be less than the amount
required under subsection (c) of this
Section, the City shall, within thirty
(30) days following receipt by the
City of its audited annual financial
statement and the written request of
the Trustee, employ a Consulting
Engineer to make recommendations
within forty-five (45) days as to a
revision of the rates, fees and charges
or Operating Expenses or methods of
operation of the System, if any, that
will result in producing the amount so
required in the next succeeding Fiscal Year. The City covenants and
agrees, promptly upon its receipt of
such recommendations, to revise the
rates, fees, and charges or Operating
Expenses or methods of operation of
the System and to take such other
action as shall be in conformity with
such recommendations to the extent
the City feasibly may do so and to
notify the Trustee of the actions it
has taken. Upon the taking by the
City of such actions, its failure to comply with subsection (c) of this Section
shall not constitute an Event of
Default.
(e) The City shall permit the authorized representative of the Trustee, or
of any Holder or Holders of twentyfive per centum (25%) of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at
the time Outstanding, to inspect the
System and all records, accounts, and
data relating to Revenues and the collection thereof, at all reasonable
times.

26
(f) The City shall not create nor
suffer to be created any pledge, lien,
or charge, except to secure Additional
Bonds issued in accordance herewith,
that would constitute a pledge or lien
prior to, or on a parity with, the
pledge of and lien on Net Revenues
created by this General Bond Ordinance and the Trust Agreement to
secure the Bonds.
(g) The City shall maintain a risk
management program that provides
protection against risks of damage or
destruction of the System and liabilities for the operations of the System.
In furtherance thereof, the City may,
among other things: self-insure in
whole or in part; adopt alternative or
supplemental risk management programs that the Council of the City
determines to be reasonable; organize
either solely or in connection with
other political subdivisions, organizations or captive insurance companies;
participate in programs of captive
insurance companies organized by
others; establish a self insurance
trust fund; participate in mutual or
other cooperative insurance or other
risk management programs or pools
with other political subdivisions or
organizations; participate in or enter
into agreements with local, State or
federal governments in order to
achieve such insurance; or participate
in other alternative risk management
programs. In case of any damage to or
destruction of any part of the System
amounting to a loss of $500,000 or
more, the City promptly shall give or
cause to be given written notice thereof to the Trustee generally describing
the nature and extent of such damage
or destruction. Regardless of whether
the net proceeds of insurance, if any,
received on account of such damage
or destruction shall be sufficient for
such purpose, the City promptly shall
commence and complete, or cause to
be commenced and completed, the
repair or restoration of the System as
nearly as practicable to the value,
condition and character thereof existing immediately prior to such damage
or destruction, with such changes or
alterations, however, as the City may
deem necessary for proper operation
of the System and as shall not impair
or diminish, in the judgment of the
City, the suitability of the System as a
water pollution control system.
(h) The City shall, for so long as
any Bonds are Outstanding, retain
under the control of the City all facilities from time to time comprising the
System, subject to disposition in the
ordinary course for substitution or
removal upon obsolescence, and will,
in the exercise of such control, comply
with all applicable requirements of
law. For purposes of this covenant,
the term “control” shall include either
the ownership or the operation of
such facilities by the City.
(i) The City shall observe and perform all its agreements and obligations provided for by the Series 2016
Bonds, any Additional Bonds, this
General Bond Ordinance or the Trust
Agreement.
(j) The City shall, for each Fiscal
Year, prepare and adopt, within the
time period and in a manner prescribed by law, a detailed budget of
the estimated Revenues and Operating Expenses of the System. The budget shall provide for all operating
Revenues, including interest income,
and all Operating Expenses and other
commitments required under the
Trust Agreement.

The City Record
(k) The City shall take whatever
action may be reasonably required to
enforce its rights against any Person
collecting charges on behalf of the
City for the use of the System and to
protect the City’s interest in any
funds collected by such Person that
are payable to the City.
All of the obligations under this
Section 20 are hereby established as
duties specifically enjoined by law
and resulting from an office, trust or
station upon the City and its officials
within the meaning of Section 2731.01
of the Ohio Revised Code.

more Financial Advisors, from time to
time, to assist the Director of Finance

required by this General Bond Ordinance to be determined by the Director of Finance or to negotiate any
Hedge Agreements. The Director of
Finance may rely on the written
advice of any Financial Advisor so
retained. The Director of Finance
may obtain the services of one or
more feasibility consultants, from
time to time, to provide reports in connection with the issuance and sale of
any Bonds or the delivery of any
Hedge Agreements concerning the
utilization and operation of the System, debt service coverage, rates and
charges or other matters. Any Financial Advisor or consultant employed
under the authority of this General
Bond Ordinance shall be disinterested
in the transaction and be independent
of the underwriters or counterparties
and any other party interested in the
transaction.

and each subdivision or paragraph of
any section is hereby declared to be

held to affect the validity of any other

the City which are inconsistent with

collect the transient occupancy tax or
to file a return or remit the tax or any
portion thereof, as required by this
chapter, and the vendor has not
received confirmation that a booking
agent has collected and remitted the
tax, the Administrator shall proceed
in such manner as he or she may deem
best to obtain information on which to
base an assessment of the tax due.
When the Administrator has obtained
such information as he or she is able,
he or she shall proceed to determine
and assess against such vendor the
tax and penalty provided for in this
chapter.
(b) In case such determination is
made, the Administrator shall serve
notice upon the vendor of the amount
so assessed, either by personal service or by registered or certified mail.
Such vendor may, within ten (10)
days after the serving or mailing of
such notice, apply in writing to the
Administrator for a hearing on the
correctness of that amount assessed.
If the vendor does not apply within
the time prescribed, the tax and
penalty determined by the Administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and
payable. If the vendor makes timely
application, the Administrator shall
give the vendor written notice not
less than five (5) days in advance in
the manner prescribed in this section,
to show cause at a time and place
fixed in the notice why the amount
specified therein should not be fixed
for such tax and penalty. At any such
hearing, the vendor may appear and
offer evidence why such specified tax
and penalty should not be so fixed.
(c) After such hearing, the Administrator shall determine the proper
amount of tax due and shall thereafter give written notice to the vendor
in the manner prescribed in this section, of such determination and the
amount of such tax and penalty. The
amount determined to be due shall be
payable after fifteen (15) days.

Referred to Directors of City Planning Commission, Law; Committee on Development Planning and Sustainability.

Ord. No. 39-16.
By Council Member Brancatelli.
An emergency ordinance extending
the moratorium on the review and
issuance of land filling permits in the
City of Cleveland unless authorization is given by Council.
Whereas, the issuance of land filling permits is governed by Chapter
561 of the Codified Ordinances; and
Whereas, Chapter 561 authorizes
the Mayor’s Office of Capital Projects
to issue permits to fill land; however,
the chapter’s very broad criteria fails
to provide community safeguards,
limitations on the amount of fill or to
require inspections of the filling
process or the type of fill;
Whereas, Chapter 561 does not
require coordination with other relevant city departments, often leaving
city departments unaware of matters
a department should be monitoring
and regulating; and
Whereas, this Council believes the
filling permit process must contain
rigorous yet reasonable regulations
that will allow for better control by
