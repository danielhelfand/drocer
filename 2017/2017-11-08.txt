ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1293-17.
By Council Members Brady, Brancatelli, Cleveland, Conwell, Cummins, Griffin, J. Johnson, K. Johnson, Kazy, Keane, Kelley, McComack, Polensek, Pruitt, Reed, and
Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
Congress to preserve the federal
Historic Tax Credit in its efforts at
tax reform and its proposed budget
plan and encouraging Ohio members
of Congress to cosponsor the Historic Tax Credit Improvement Act.
Whereas, the federal Historic Tax
Credit (HTC) was created in 1981 as
a tool to drive economic development through the restoration and
reuse of America’s historic buildings; and
Whereas, the HTC is a widely
used redevelopment tool, helping to
revitalize cities, towns and rural
communities across the country; the
HTS stimulates economic growth
through private investment that creates jobs; and
Whereas, the HTC program establishes a 20% income tax credit for
the
rehabilitation
of
historic,
income-producing buildings that are
determined by the U.S. Secretary of
the Interior, through the National
Park Service, to be certified historic
structures; and
Whereas, the tax incentives for
preservation attract private investment to the historic cores of cities
and towns; generate jobs, enhance
property values, and augment revenues for state and local governments through increased property,
business and income taxes; and
Whereas, cities like Cleveland
lack authority to raise local revenues to offset deep and unending
cuts to federal grants and tax incentives; this means that tax incentives
like
HTC
are
irreplaceable
as
sources of financing for local community and economic development;
and
Whereas, recently, federal Republican leadership released a tax
reform framework that does not
specifically preserve the HTC and
“envisions” that most business tax
credits will be repealed; and
Whereas, while the need for tax
reform is clear, it must not come at
the expense of the HTC: an important economic redevelopment incentive that more than pays for itself,
and has a proven track record of
creating jobs, saving historic buildings and revitalizing neighborhoods;
and

Project Summary
CAC Project 2014 Limited Liability Company, or designee, (“Redeveloper”) is proposing to redevelop the
Cleveland Athletic Club located at
1118-1148 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland,
OH 44115 (“Project Site”) to include
165 units of residential space, 49
indoor parking spaces, 6,800 SF
office space and 3,990 SF first floor
retail space. CAC Project 2014 Limited Liability Company is an Ohio
limited liability company, which is
wholly-owned by Cleveland Euclid
Hotel Associates, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the “Parent”). The managers of the Parent
are principals of Great Lakes Financial Group, Precision Environmental
and Weingart Development.
The century-old, 16-story Cleveland Athletic Club has been vacant

1950

November 8, 2017
since 2007. After a number of development blocks and hurdles, the
Redeveloper took ownership of the
building in Spring 2015 with the
intent of moving the project forward. Great Lakes Financial Group
proposes to relocate their offices to
the new office space in the Cleveland Athletic Club, with their current first floor location on Huron
Road
backfilled
with
additional
retail amenities. The Redeveloper is
targeting service-based retail, such
as a pharmacy, for the first floor
retail at the project.
The total development cost for the
project is approximately $62.8 million. The Redeveloper has incurred
significant costs to date, removing
asbestos from the property and conducting some interior demolition.
The Redeveloper has requested a
TIF to address the remaining funding gap, a result of the building’s
extended vacancy, deferred maintenance needs and the high cost of
construction. Many aesthetic features of the athletic club's original
space will stay, as the project was
awarded Historic Tax Credits as
part of the capital stack.
The property is a critical piece to
completing the redevelopment of
Euclid Avenue, stitching together
Downtown and Playhouse Square.
The redevelopment of this building
will eliminate one of the last major
development
gaps
along
Euclid
Avenue in this area. In addition, the
project will support the residential
downtown
where
rental
demand
occupancy is near record highs.
Proposed City Assistance
• This ordinance will authorize the
Director of Economic Development to enter into a 30-year nonschool Tax Increment Finance
(TIF) agreement with CAC Project 2014 Limited Liability Company and/or its designee. The
City will have declared certain
improvements with respect to the
project to be a public purpose and
exempt 100% of the improvements
from real property taxes. The project is subject to a 15-year residential tax abatement, which is
intended to have priority over the
TIF exemption. The TIF will, in
effect, be on the commercial real
estate for the first 15 years and
will capture the full value in the
remaining 15 years.
• The Redeveloper agrees to make
certain improvements to those
parcels and make payments in
lieu of taxes (PILOTs) equal to
the taxes that would have been
paid for those parcels but for the
TIF. A portion of the PILOTs will
be paid to the Cleveland Metropolitan School District in the
amount the District would have
otherwise received but for the
TIF by the County (District payments). The Redeveloper will be
responsible for any shortfall of
PILOT payments for project costs
through a “Minimum Service Payment” requirement.
• This ordinance will authorize the
Director of Economic Development to enter into a Cooperative
Agreement with the ClevelandCuyahoga County Port Authority
and to assign the PILOTs, exclusive of the District payments, and
the Minimum Service Payments to
the Port Authority to provide the
necessary gap financing for the
project.
