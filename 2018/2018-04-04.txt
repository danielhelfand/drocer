DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
SUMMARY FOR THE LEGISLATIVE FILE
Playhouse Square Tower
East 17th/Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44115
Playhouse Square
Robin Brown
3 - McCormack
Non-School TIF

Project Summary and Discussion
Playhouse Square Foundation or designee, (“Developer”) is proposing to develop a 34-story, 315-unit residential
tower on the existing parking lot at the Southwest corner of E. 17th & Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44115 (“Project Site”). The project would consist of a 4-story 550-space parking garage with residential use above. The first
floor of the garage would include space that could be developed for retail if a substantial and viable tenant
emerges. In order to assist with the project financing, Playhouse Square has requested the City impose a 5709.41,
30-Year, Non-school TIF. The TIF will support debt service related to the project and assist with the development
of the residential tower and garage. The project will create and/or cause to create 10 new W-2 jobs at the Project Site. Estimated value of TIF is $4,200,000.
Playhouse has been working on this project for several years. They view this project as a key element to the
revitalization of the Playhouse Square district, providing a crowning building to anchor the eastern end of the
district before giving way to the CSU Campus. In order to advance the project, Playhouse has been selling and
refinancing its real estate holdings in order to generate the substantial cash on-hand to invest in this project.
The project will remove a low-quality surface parking lot from the downtown area and is expected to attract
over 300 new residents and create 10 jobs in downtown.

Proposed City Assistance
• This ordinance will authorize the Director of Economic Development to enter into a 30-year non-school Tax
Increment Finance (TIF) agreement with Playhouse Square Foundation and/or its designee. The City will
have declared certain improvements with respect to the project to be a public purpose and exempt 100% of
the improvements from real property taxes.
• The Developer agrees to make certain improvements to the parcel and make payments in lieu of taxes
(PILOTs) equal to the taxes that would have been paid for the parcel but for the TIF. A portion of the
PILOTs will be paid to the Cleveland Metropolitan School District in the amount the District would have otherwise received but for the TIF by the County (“District Payments”). The balance of the PILOTS will be
utilized to fund eligible project costs and project debt. The developer will be responsible for any shortfall
of PILOT payments for project costs.
• The TIF will be immediately effective on the residential tower and new parking garage after the expiration of the 15-year tax abatement for new residential construction.

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 393-18.
By Council Member Griffin.
An emergency resolution calling
upon the Ohio legislature to enact a
“red flag” law that would allow the
seizure of guns before a person can
commit an act of violence against
self or others.
Whereas, currently there is an
innovative law enacted in at least
five states known as the “red flag”
law that allows law enforcement to
seize guns from individuals determined to be a threat to themselves
or others; and
Whereas, “red flag” laws in California, Washington, Oregon, Indiana
and Connecticut can be used by family members or law enforcement to

ask a judge for a “gun violence
restraining order” or an “extreme
risk protection order” based on
someone’s
violent
or
troubling
behavior; and
Whereas, in Connecticut between
1999-2013, researchers found that
police served 762 risk warrants,
about 50 instances per year, and
estimated that a gun suicide was
prevented for every 10-20 seizures;
police found guns in 99% of the
cases in which they served warrants
and seized an average of 7 firearms
from each person; and
Whereas, removal of the gun via
a “red flag” law is limited and targeted toward specific individuals
and would create opportunities for
more social services to address mental health and other safety issues;
and

476

Whereas, 18 other states, including Florida and the District of
Columbia have proposed “red flag”
laws; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland
Section 1. That this Council hereby calls upon the Ohio legislature to
enact a “red flag” law that would
allow the seizure of guns before a
person can commit an act of violence against self or others.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to Governor John
Kasich and to all members of the
Ohio legislature.

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

shall take effect and be in force

An emergency resolution supporting the millions of young people in
their “Enough is Enough” movement demanding that Congress and,
locally, the Ohio legislature pass
reasonable gun safety legislation.
Whereas, on March 24, 2018, millions of America’s youth declared
“enough is enough” by participating
in a “March for Our Lives” that generated hundreds of marches across
the country and the world; and
Whereas,
these
young
people
marched to demand an end to gun
violence in the nation’s schools and
in the nation’s streets, and insist
that Congress pass legislation that
requires
universal
background
checks,
prohibits
civilians
from
acquiring
assault
weapons,
and

The City Record
bans high-capacity magazines and
bump stocks; and
Whereas,
students
from
many
northeast Ohio schools marched here
in Cleveland as one of 800 marches
planned internationally, spearheaded by students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the site of the latest
mass shooting that took 17 innocent
lives; and
Whereas, the March for Our Lives
movement
here
in
Cleveland
brought an estimated 20,000 people
to Public Square in solidarity with
March
for
Our
Lives
marchers
around the country, protesting gun
violence in our society and calling
for reasonable gun safety laws; and
Whereas,
beginning
with
the
shooting at Columbine High School
in 1999, more than 187,000 students
attending at least 196 primary or
secondary schools have experienced
a shooting on campus during school
hours; and
Whereas, that number – 187,000 –
means that the number of children
who have witnessed gunfire in their
schools exceeds the population of
Eugene, Oregon, or Fort Lauderdale,
Florida; and
Whereas, since Columbine in 1999,
there have been an average of 10
school shootings per year; and
Whereas, in 2007, a troubled freshman brought guns and knives to
Cleveland’s SuccessTech Academy
shooting at teachers and students;
the shooter shot two teachers and
two students before killing himself;
thankfully, all the victims survived;
and
Whereas, children are affected by
gun
violence,
not
only
in
our
nation’s schools, but also in movie
theaters, night clubs and in city
streets; and
Whereas, this Council congratulates these young people for their
commitment and activism and supports them in their fight to take
back their schools and their lives,
and in their demand for reasonable
gun safety laws here in Ohio and in
these United States; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the millions of young
